  description: This International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP)
    Initiative II data set is based on the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Sea
    Ice Concentrations from Nimbus-7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR)
    and the Defense Meteorological Satellites Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave/Imager
    (SSM/I) Passive Microwave Data. This data set contains four zip files which includes
    sea ice concentration (in percentage of ocean area covered by sea ice), table
    data and map data. These original data were re-gridded by the National Snow and
    Ice Data Center (NSIDC) from their original 25-km spatial resolution and EASE-Grid
    into equal angle Earth grids with quarter, half and one degree spatial resolutions
    in latitude/longitude. The ISLSCP II staff have taken the one degree resolution
    original data provided by the Principal Investigator and created global maps of
    monthly sea ice concentration on a global one degree grid using the latitude and
    longitude coordinates that were provided. Individual monthly files were created
    and written to the ASCII format. The re-gridded one degree original data were
    also adjusted to match the one degree ISLSCP II land/water mask.

  description: This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated
    from the Noah land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North American Land
    Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing
    and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly. The
    file format is WMO GRIB-1. Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Noah
    LSM can be found in Xia et al. (2012). The Noah model was developed as the land
    component of the NOAA NCEP mesoscale Eta model [Betts et al. (1997); Chen et al.
    (1997); Ek et al. (2003)]. As used in NLDAS-2, recent modifications were made
    to Noah's cold-season [Livneh et al. (2010)] and warm-season [Wei et al. (2012)]
    parameterizations. Noah serves as the land component in the evolving Weather Research
    and Forecasting (WRF) regional atmospheric model, the NOAA NCEP coupled Climate
    Forecast System (CFS), and the Global Forecast System (GFS). The model simulates
    the soil freeze-thaw process and its impact on soil heating/cooling and transpiration,
    following Koren et al. (1999). The model has four soil layers with spatially invariant
    thicknesses of 10, 30, 60, and 100 cm. The first three layers form the root zone
    in non-forested regions, with the fourth layer included in forested regions. The
    Noah LSM was forced by the hourly NLDAS-2 forcing "File A" files, and contains
    fifty-two fields. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate
    the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_NOAH.002.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition

  description: CEAREX was a multi-platform field program conducted in the Norwegian
    Seas and Greenland north to Svalbard from September 1988 through May 1989. Canada,
    Denmark, France, Norway and the United States participated in the experiment.
    Primary data from CEAREX are available on FTP in ASCII format along with some
    data from the Marginal Ice Zone Experiment (MIZEX) and the Eurasian Basin Experiment
    (EUBEX). Meteorology data from CEAREX and the MIZEX (1983, 1984, 1987) include
    near-surface time series and rawinsonde (upper-air sounding) profiles of wind,
    pressure, temperature, and humidity collected on ship platforms and ice floe stations.
    A collection of hydrography data include CTD, STD, and bottle data from a ship
    and two operations camps. Hydrography data also include data from the MIZEX, the
    EUBEX, NODC archives, and a merged set of data from five other cruises. Sea ice
    data consist of compressive stress measurements made in a multi-year floe, stress
    sensor data for time series of stress invariants, and ice accelerometer data for
    movements associated with the deformation of multi-year ice floes. Noise data
    consist of acoustic measurements from a variety of hydrophone and geophone arrays,
    and ambient noise observations from a ship using omni-directional hydrophones
    tethered beneath the ice cover. Biophysical data include bottle sample, zooplankton
    sampling, and bioluminescence data. Bathymetry data consist of gridded trackline
    data collected from the two operations camps, and digital bottom bathymetry and
    continental topography data for the Fram Strait region and a portion of the Arctic
    Ocean. Sample position data consist of hourly listings of position and velocity
    for both manned stations and unmanned drifting buoys. Data are available via FTP.

  description: 'The Comprehensive Ocean - Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) LMRF Arctic
    subset contains marine surface weather reports for the region north of 65 degrees
    N from ships, drifting ice stations, and buoys. COADS is the result of an ongoing
    project to assemble and reduce machine-readable portions of the available historical
    ocean-atmosphere record into a regular, compact, easy-to-use database. The COADS
    LMRF Arctic subset contains data collected over the years 1950 to 1995. The following
    parameters are included in this data set: air and sea temperature, cloudiness,
    humidity, and winds. The scientists assembling COADS have attempted to integrate
    all available digitized, directly sensed surface-marine data sets that would contribute
    information of reasonable quality. Most of the early data were gathered by ships-of-opportunity.
    More recent data also come from fixed research vessels, buoys, and other observing
    devices. Data archived at NSIDC is for the region North of 65 degrees N. for the
    years 1950-1995. Updates will be made available as they are received at NSIDC.
    The COADS LMRF Arctic subset consists of 46 data files (one for each year) which
    are in LMRF (Long Marine Report Fixed-Length, packed binary format), and has a
    total volume of approximately 201 MB UNIX compressed, and 632 MB uncompressed.
    The data are in the form of individual marine reports with a given latitude and
    longitude. A UNIX-based Fortran program is distributed with the data files.'

  description: This data set contains the secondary forcing data "File B" for Phase
    2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are
    in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal
    resolution is hourly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. Details about the generation
    of the NLDAS-2 forcing datasets can be found in Xia et al. (2012). The non-precipitation
    land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of
    the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). NARR analysis fields are 32-km
    spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency. Those NARR fields that are
    utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the
    finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated
    to the NLDAS hourly frequency. NLDAS-2 is providing a second forcing file, "File
    B", in which the surface temperature, humidity, and wind fields are represented
    not at 2-meters and 10-meters above the height of the NLDAS terrain, but rather
    at the same height above the NLDAS terrain as the height above the NARR terrain
    of the lowest prognostic level of the NARR assimilation system (namely, the same
    height above the model terrain as the lowest prognostic level of the mesoscale
    Eta model, which is the assimilating model in NARR). The surface downward surface
    radiation field in "File B" is taken directly from NARR, without any bias correction.
    The precipitation and convective precipitation fields in "File B" are also taken
    directly from NARR, and are used to calculate the convective fraction provided
    in "File A". The aerodynamic conductance is "File B" is also taken from NARR.
    The hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two GRIB files,
    "File A" and "File B". "File B" is the secondary (optional) forcing file and contains
    ten fields. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the
    contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs
    /gribtab_NLDAS_FORB_hourly.002.txt) shows a list of parameters for this data set,
    along with their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units. For more information,

  description: The total annual freezing and thawing indices are defined as the cumulative
    number of degree-days when air temperatures are below and above zero degrees Celsius.
    The total annual freezing index has been widely used to predict permafrost distribution;
    estimate the maximum thickness of sea, lake, and river ice, and the maximum depth
    of ground-frost penetration; and classify snow types. The annual total thawing
    index has been used to predict permafrost distribution and to estimate the maximum
    depth of thaw in frozen ground. Both total freezing and thawing indices are important
    parameters for engineering design in cold regions. Data coverage is global. The
    data set contains the total annual freezing and thawing indices with a spatial
    resolution of 0.5 degrees latitude by 0.5 degrees longitude. Two data files are
    available, for the freeze and thaw indices respectively, in flat binary format.
    Each file is approximately 1 MB in size. The total annual freezing and thawing
    indexes were calculated based upon the monthly mean air temperature by Legates
    and Willmott (1990).

  description: This data set contains the monthly secondary forcing data "File B"
    for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The
    data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present.
    The temporal resolution is monthly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. The NLDAS-2
    monthly secondary forcing data were generated from the NLDAS-2 hourly secondary
    forcing data, as monthly accumulation for precipitation and convective precipitation
    and monthly average for other variables. Monthly period of each month is from
    00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z at end of the month. The one exception to
    this is the first month (Jan. 1979) that starts from 00Z 02 Jan 1979, except for
    the monthly accumulated precipitation and convective precipitation that both start
    from 12Z 01 Jan 1979. Brief description about the NLDAS-2 hourly secondary forcing
    data can be found from the GCMD DIF for GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORB0125_H_V002 at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORB0125_H_V002.
    Details about the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing datasets can be found in Xia
    et al. (2012). The NLDAS-2 monthly land surface forcing fields are grouped into
    two GRIB files, "File A" and "File B". "File B" is the secondary (optional) forcing
    file and contains ten fields. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table
    to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_FORB_monthly.002.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition
    Section (PDS) IDs and units. For more information, please see the README Document

  description: Phase 2 of the VEMAP Project developed historical (1895-1993) gridded
    data sets of climate (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, humidity, and
    wind speed) and projected (1994-2100) gridded annual and monthly climate data
    sets using output from two climate system models [CCCma (Canadian Centre for Climate
    Modeling and Analysis) and Hadley Centre models]. Two Phase 2 model experiments
    were run. First, a set of selected biogeochemical models and coupled biogeochemical-biogeographical
    models were run from 1895 to 1993 to compare model responses to the historical
    time series and current ecosystem biogeochemistry. Second, these same models were
    run on the projected 1994 to 2100 data to compare their ecological responses to
    transient scenarios of climate and atmospheric CO2 change. Model runs were performed
    for daily, monthly, and annual gridded data sets. The output of the annual model
    runs in VEMAP grid format are contained in this data set. The models investigated
    included five biogeochemical cycling models, which simulate plant production and
    nutrient cycles.

  description: The data set consists of monthly global snow cover and snow depth derived
    from Nimbus-7 SMMR data for 1978 through 1987. The SMMR data are interpolated
    for spatial and temporal gaps, and averaged for display in polar stereographic
    projection. Maps are based on six-day average brightness temperature data from
    the middle week of each month. Data are placed into 1/2 degree latitude by 1/2
    degree longitude grid cells uniformly subdividing a polar stereographic map according
    to the geographic coordinates of the center of the radiometers' fields of view.
    Overlapping data from separate orbits in the same six-day period are averaged
    to give a single brightness temperature assumed to be at the cell's center. Oceans
    and bays are masked so that only microwave data for land areas are displayed.
    Comparisons of SMMR snow cover maps with previous maps produced by NOAA/NESDIS
    and US Air Force Global Weather Center indicate that the total snow covered area
    derived from SMMR is usually about ten percent less than that measured by the
    earlier products, because passive microwave sensors often can't detect shallow
    dry snow less than about 5 cm deep. Snow depths are comparable, showing SMMR results
    to be especially good for uniform snow covered areas such as the Canadian high
    plains and Russian steppes. Heavily forested and mountainous areas tend to mask
    the microwave snow signatures, and SMMR snow depth derivations are less reliable
    in those areas. Formerly distributed by NASA/GSFC/NSSDC and NASA Pilot Land Data
    System (PLDS), these data are now available via ftp from NSIDC.

  description: These sea ice concentrations have been generated by applying the NASA
    Team algorithm to DMSP F8 SSM/I brightness temperature observations from 19 GHz
    (vertical and horizontal), 37- and 22 GHz vertical frequencies, calculating two
    gradients for use as weather filters. Global coverage is provided, but sea ice
    concentrations are only derived for ocean, ice, and possible ice surfaces poleward
    of 35 degrees latitude, from 1 August 1987 through 30 November 1988. In the Northern
    Hemisphere, where data are not filtered due to weather effects, first-year and
    multi-year concentrations (in percent) are calculated; total ice concentration
    is taken as the sum of these two. Only total ice is calculated for the Southern
    Hemisphere. 25 km swath data are in HDF, available via FTP.

  description: A gridded climatological monthly-mean data base of Arctic water vapor
    characteristics has been assembled by combining fixed station data with data from
    soundings taken over the Arctic Ocean from ships and Russian drifting stations.
    Variables provided include temperature, specific humidity, zonal vapor flux, meridional
    vapor flux, zonal wind speed, and meridional wind speed, available for 15 levels
    extending from the surface and then at every 50 mb from 950 mb to 300 mb; sea
    level pressure and geopotential height, available at 850 mb, 700 mb, 500 mb and
    300 mb; and precipitable water, vertically integrated zonal vapor flux and vertically
    integrated meridional vapor flux, available for five layers, surface to 850 mb,
    850 to 700 mb, 700 to 500 mb, 500 to 400 mb and 400 to 300 mb. Coverage of the
    rawinsonde archives extends from 1945 through 1990 for data from the Russian North
    Pole series of drifting ice stations over the Arctic Ocean; from 1976 through
    1991 for fixed-station data obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric
    Research; and from about 1958 through 1991 for fixed-station data obtained from
    the Historical Arctic Rawinsonde Archive. All variables were obtained through
    interpolation of the raw sounding data, with the exception of sea level pressure
    and geopotential height. The file, available via ftp, is structured in monthly
    data arrays over a subsection of the National Meteorological Center grid (octagonal
    grid format) centered over the pole, extending to approximately 65 degrees North
    on each side and about 55 degrees North at the corners.

    on gas flux from soil following rewetting or thawing. The resulting database includes
    222 field and laboratory observations focused on rewetting of dry soils, and 116
    field laboratory observations focused on thawing of frozen soils studies conducted
    from 1956 to 2010. Fluxes of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, nitrogen
    oxide, and ammonia (CO2, CH4, N2O, NO and NH3) were compiled from the literature
    and the flux rates were normalized for ease of comparison. Field observations
    of gas flux following rewetting of dry soils include events caused by natural
    rainfall, simulated rainfall in natural ecosystems, and irrigation in agricultural
    lands. Similarly, thawing of frozen soils include field observations of natural
    thawing, simulated freezing-thawing events (i.e., thawing of simulated frozen
    soil by snow removal), and thawing of seasonal ice in temperate and high latitude
    regions (Kim et al., 2012). Reported parameters include experiment type, location,
    site type, vegetation, climate, soil properties, rainfall, soil moisture, soil
    gas flux after wetting and thawing, peak soil gas flux properties, and the corresponding
    study references. There is one comma-delimited data file.

    beam and instrument mode. This data set contains both slice and egg images for
    each day. The Microwave Earth Remote Sensing (MERS) group at Brigham Young University
    (BYU) developed a SIR-with-filtering (SIRF) algorithm that combines forward- and
    aft-looking sigma-0 measurements to produce enhanced-resolution backscatter images
    over various azimuth angles. The polarization ratio, incidence angle dependence,
    and the sigma-0 estimate error standard deviation were used to discriminate between
    sea ice and ocean. Sea ice extent was estimated for both slice and egg images.
    The nominal pixel resolution of the slice images is 2.225 km with an estimated
    effective resolution of approximately 4 km. Egg images have a nominal pixel resolution
    of 4.45 km with an estimated effective resolution of approximately 8 to 10 km.

  description: 'Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (hereafter, GLDAS-2)
    has two components: one forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing
    data (hereafter, GLDAS-2.0), and the other forced with a combination of model
    and observation based forcing data sets (hereafter, GLDAS-2.1). This data set,
    GLDAS-2.0 1.0 degree monthly generated through temporal averaging of the 3-hourly
    data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model
    3.3, currently covers from 1948 to 2010 and will be extended to recent years as
    the data set becomes available. The model simulation was initialized on simulation
    date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM
    climatology for that day of the year. The simulation was forced by the global
    meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006).
    The simulation used the common GLDAS data sets for land cover (MCD12Q1: Friedl
    et al., 2010), land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009), soil texture (Reynolds,
    1999), and elevation (GTOPO30). The MODIS based land surface parameters are used
    in the current GLDAS-2.x products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in
    GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012). The main objective
    for Version 2 is to create more climatologically consistent data sets using the
    Princeton forcing data sets extending from 1948. In Version 1, forcing sources
    switched several times throughout the record from 1979 to present, which introduced
    unnatural trends and exhibited highly uncertain forcing fields in 1995-1997. Other
    enhancements made in Version 2 include model version upgrade, switching to MODIS
    based land surface parameter data sets, and initialization of soil moisture over
    desert. In NOAH model, the bottom layer temperature data set was also updated.
    More details regarding the land surface parameter data changes at http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas/.
    WGRIB or other GRIB reader is required to read the files. The data set applies
    a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter numbers.

  description: 'This data set contains the primary forcing data "File A" for Phase
    2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are
    in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal
    resolution is hourly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. Details about the generation
    of the NLDAS-2 forcing data sets can be found in Xia et al. (2012). The non-precipitation
    land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from the analysis fields of
    the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). NARR analysis fields are 32-km
    spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency. Those NARR fields that are
    utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially interpolated to the
    finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally disaggregated
    to the NLDAS hourly frequency. Additionally, the fields of surface pressure, surface
    downward longwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, and near-surface specific
    humidity are adjusted vertically to account for the vertical difference between
    the NARR and NLDAS fields of terrain height. This vertical adjustment applies
    the traditional vertical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km for air temperature. The details
    of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment
    are those employed in NLDAS-1, as presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003). The surface
    downward shortwave radiation field in "File A" is a bias-corrected field wherein
    a bias-correction algorithm was applied to the NARR surface downward shortwave
    radiation. This bias correction utilizes five years (1996-2000) of the hourly
    1/8th-degree GOES-based surface downward shortwave radiation fields derived by
    Pinker et al. (2003). The potential evaporation field in "File A" is that computed
    in NARR using the modified Penman scheme of Mahrt and Ek (1984). The precipitation
    field in "File A" is not the NARR precipitation forcing, but is rather a product
    of a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis of daily precipitation,
    performed directly on the NLDAS grid and including an orographic adjustment based
    on the widely-applied PRISM climatology. The precipitation is temporally disaggregated
    into hourly fields by deriving hourly disaggregation weights from either WSR-88D
    Doppler radar-based precipitation estimates, 8-km CMORPH hourly precipitation
    analyses, or NARR-simulated precipitation (based on availability, in order). The
    latter fields from radar, CMORPH, and NARR are used only to derive disaggregation
    weights and do not change the daily total precipitation. The field in "File A"
    that gives the fraction of total precipitation that is convective is an estimate
    derived from the following two NARR precipitation fields (which are provided in
    "File B"): NARR total precipitation and NARR convective precipitation (the latter
    is less than or equal to the NARR total precipitation and can be zero). The Convective
    Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final variable in the forcing data set,
    also interpolated from NARR. The hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2
    are grouped into two GRIB files, "File A" and "File B". "File A" is the primary
    (default) forcing file and contains eleven fields. The data set applies a user-defined
    parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file
    (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_FORA_hourly.002.txt)

  description: 'This data set provides two products that were derived from the recently
    published North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis 1-degree terrestrial
    biosphere model (TBM) and inverse model (IM) outputs (Gridded 1-deg Observation
    Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs, Wei et al., 2013). The first product
    is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM and IM outputs to
    the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North America (United
    States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability, the monthly/yearly
    Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP), Total Vegetation Carbon
    (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions (FE) outputs from the
    22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree resolution gridded format
    to the inventory zones and then, further divided into Forest Lands, Crop Lands,
    and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based on the 1-km resolution
    GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product is the North American
    national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones which contain estimated
    land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands, crop lands, and other lands
    sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based data on productivity,
    ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock change, and additional
    information from national-level GHG inventories of the United States, Canada,
    and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada (2011).An additional summary
    file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for both land sectors and reporting
    zones in North America and was created by combining the aggregated model output
    and the national GHG database and is provided. The aggregated monthly and yearly
    model output data and the national GHG inventories data are available in comma
    separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided are detailed inventory zone
    spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone names, boundaries, and zone
    and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience, the inventory zones
    shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands masks to create a
    1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF format. The
    GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km grid cell
    belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content, format,
    and processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions of
    the TBMs and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional

    from the NLDAS-2 hourly Mosaic model data, as monthly accumulation for rainfall,
    snowfall, subsurface runoff, surface runoff, total evapotranspiration, and snow
    melt, and monthly average for other variables. Monthly period of each month is
    from 00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z at end of the month, except the first
    month (Jan. 1979) that starts from 00Z 02 Jan 1979. Brief description about the
    NLDAS-2 monthly Mosaic model can be found from the GCMD DIF for NLDAS-2 hourly
    Mosaic data GES_DISC_NLDAS_MOS0125_H_V002 at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_MOS0125_H_V002.
    Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Mosaic LSM can be found in Xia
    et al. (2012). The NLDAS-2 monthly Mosaic model data contain thirty-seven fields.
    The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and
    parameter number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_MOS.002.txt)

  description: 'This data set contains the original model output data submissions
    from the 24 terrestrial biosphere models (TBM) that participated in the North
    American Carbon Program (NACP) Site-Level Synthesis. The model teams generated
    estimates for, but not limited to, a minimum of six variables, including gross
    primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), leaf area index (LAI),
    ecosystem respiration (Re), latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H)
    for each of 47 selected eddy covariance flux tower sites across North America.
    Participating modeling teams followed the NACP Site Synthesis Protocol (site_synthesis_protocol_v7.pdf),
    which covers procedures, plans, and infrastructure for the site-level analyses.
    File format and units conversions of several data submissions were made by the
    MAST-DC to produce NetCDF files of consistent content and structure for all 24
    TBM outputs. The model outputs are structured as described in Appendix A: Model
    Output Variables, of the Site Synthesis Protocol. In addition, MAST-DC processed
    these original model submissions to derive uniquely processed and formatted data
    files for model inter-comparison and evaluation (NACP Site: Terrestrial Biosphere
    Model and Aggregated Flux Data in Standard Format). This related data set provides
    GPP, NEE, LAI, Re, LE, and sensible heat (H) model output variables at the native
    half-hourly time step, and in daily, monthly, and annual aggregations. The related
    data set also contains gap-filled observations and total uncertainty estimates
    at the same time steps.There are 24 compressed (*.zip) files with this data set
    -- one file for each model. When expanded, the .zip files contain model output
    data files for flux tower sites in NetCDF and some in text formats.'

    Report (AR4) Observed Climate Change Impacts Database contains observed responses
    to climate change across a wide range of systems as well as regions. These data
    were taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment
    Report and Rosenzweig et al. (2008). It consists of responses in the the physical,
    terrestrial biological systems and marine-ecosystems. The observations that were
    selected include data that demonstrate a statistically significant trend in change
    in either direction in systems related to temperature or other climate change
    variable, and the is for at least 20 years between 1970 and 2004, although study
    periods may extend earlier or later. For each observation, the data series is
    described in terms of system, region, longitude and latitude, dates and duration,
    statistical significance, type of impact, and whether or not land use was identified
    as a driving factor. System changes are taken from about 80 studies (of which
    about 75 are new since the IPCC Third Assessment Report) containing more than
    29,500 data series. Observations in the database are characterized as a change
    consistent with warming or a change not consistent with warming based on information
    from the underlying studies. The data is distributed by the Columbia University
    Center for Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).

  description: 'Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (hereafter, GLDAS-2)
    has two components: one forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing
    data (hereafter, GLDAS-2.0), and the other forced with a combination of model
    and observation based forcing data sets (hereafter, GLDAS-2.1). This data set,
    GLDAS-2.0 0.25 degree 3-hourly, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated
    from the Noah Model 3.3, currently covers from 1948 to 2010 and will be extended
    to recent years as the data set becomes available. The model simulation was initialized
    on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields
    from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulation was forced by
    the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield
    et al., 2006). The simulation used the common GLDAS data sets for land cover (MCD12Q1:
    Friedl et al., 2010), land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009), soil texture
    (Reynolds, 1999), and elevation (GTOPO30). The MODIS based land surface parameters
    are used in the current GLDAS-2.x products while the AVHRR base parameters were
    used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012). The main
    objective for Version 2 is to create more climatologically consistent data sets
    using the Princeton forcing data sets extending from 1948. In Version 1, forcing
    sources switched several times throughout the record from 1979 to present, which
    introduced unnatural trends and exhibited highly uncertain forcing fields in 1995-1997.
    Other enhancements made in Version 2 include model version upgrade, switching
    to MODIS based land surface parameter data sets, and initialization of soil moisture
    over desert. In NOAH model, the bottom layer temperature data set was also updated.
    More details regarding the land surface parameter data changes at http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas/.
    WGRIB or other GRIB reader is required to read the files. The data set applies
    a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter numbers.
    The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_GLDAS_V2.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition

  description: 'A comprehensive global database has been assembled to quantify CO2
    fluxes and pathways across different levels of integration (from photosynthesis
    up to net ecosystem production) in forest ecosystems. The database fills an important
    gap for model calibration, model validation, and hypothesis testing at global
    and regional scales. The database archive includes: a Microsoft Office Access
    Database; data files for all tables in the database; query outputs from the database;
    and SQL script file for re-creating the database from the tables. The database
    is structured by site (i.e., a forest or stand of known geographical location,
    biome, species composition, and management regime). It contains carbon budget
    variables (fluxes and stocks), ecosystem traits (standing biomass, leaf area index,
    age), and ancillary information (management regime, climate, soil characteristics)
    for 529 sites from eight forest biomes. Data entries originated from peer-reviewed
    literature and personal communications with researchers involved in Fluxnet. Flux
    estimates were included in the database when they were based on direct measurements
    (e.g., tower-based eddy covariance system measurements), derived from single or
    multiple direct measurements, or modeled. Stand description was based on observed
    values, and climatic description was based on the CRU data set and ORCHIDEE model
    output. Uncertainty for each carbon balance component in the database was estimated
    in a uniformed way by expert judgment. Robustness of CO2 balances was tested,
    and closure terms were introduced as a numerical way to approach data quality
    and flux uncertainty at the biome level.'

  description: This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated
    from the VIC land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data
    Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range
    from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly. The file format
    is WMO GRIB-1. Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the VIC LSM can be found
    in Xia et al. (2012). The version of the VIC model for the NLDAS-2 VIC data available
    from the NASA GES DISC is VIC-4.0.3; this version of the VIC model is the same
    as used in Sheffield et al. (2003). The VIC model was developed at the University
    of Washington and Princeton University as a macroscale, semi-distributed, grid-based,
    hydrologic model [Liang et al., 1994; Wood et al., 1997]. The full water and energy
    balance modes of VIC were used for NLDAS-2. VIC uses three soil layers, with thicknesses
    that vary spatially. The root zone depends on the vegetation type and its root
    distribution, and can span all three soil layers. The VIC model includes a two-layer
    energy balance snow model [Cherkauer et al., 2003]. The VIC LSM was forced by
    the hourly NLDAS-2 forcing "File A" files, and contains forty-three fields. The
    data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter
    number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_VIC.002.txt)

  description: 'Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (hereafter, GLDAS-2)
    has two components: one forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing
    data (hereafter, GLDAS-2.0), and the other forced with a combination of model
    and observation based forcing data sets (hereafter, GLDAS-2.1). This data set,
    GLDAS-2.0 0.25 degree monthly generated through temporal averaging of the 3-hourly
    data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model
    3.3, currently covers from 1948 to 2010 and will be extended to recent years as
    the data set becomes available. The model simulation was initialized on simulation
    date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM
    climatology for that day of the year. The simulation was forced by the global
    meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006).
    The simulation used the common GLDAS data sets for land cover (MCD12Q1: Friedl
    et al., 2010), land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009), soil texture (Reynolds,
    1999), and elevation (GTOPO30). The MODIS based land surface parameters are used
    in the current GLDAS-2.x products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in
    GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012). The main objective
    for Version 2 is to create more climatologically consistent data sets using the
    Princeton forcing data sets extending from 1948. In Version 1, forcing sources
    switched several times throughout the record from 1979 to present, which introduced
    unnatural trends and exhibited highly uncertain forcing fields in 1995-1997. Other
    enhancements made in Version 2 include model version upgrade, switching to MODIS
    based land surface parameter data sets, and initialization of soil moisture over
    desert. In NOAH model, the bottom layer temperature data set was also updated.
    More details regarding the land surface parameter data changes at http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas/.
    WGRIB or other GRIB reader is required to read the files. The data set applies
    a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter numbers.
    The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_GLDAS_V2.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition
    Section (PDS) IDs and units. There are four vertical levels for the Soil Moisture
    (PDS 086) and Soil Temperature (PDS 085) in the Noah GRIB files. For more information,

    laser altimetry, shallow to intermediate ice cores (for average accumulation rates
    and their temporal and spatial variability), velocity around the ice-sheet perimeter
    at an elevation of about 2000 meters, local ice thickening/thinning rates, and
    climatological observations from automatic weather stations. Satellite data used
    include elevation change from radar altimetry; mapping of snow facies and zones
    of summer melt from passive and active microwave; ice velocities from interferometric
    synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and from repeat high-resolution visible and SAR
    imagery; mapping surface and 10-m temperatures, accumulation rates, and surface
    albedo from microwave and AVHRR data. Data are available either by FTP or through
    investigator Web sites. Questions about investigator data should be directed to
    the individual technical contacts responsible for each data set. The National
    Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) provides summaries and links to these data as
    a service to our users.

  description: This data set provides standardized output variables for gross primary
    productivity (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), leaf area index (LAI), ecosystem
    respiration (Re), latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H) from 24 terrestrial
    biosphere models for 47 eddy covariance flux tower sites in North America. Each
    model used standardized input data for each flux tower site (i.e., gap-filled,
    locally observed weather; land use history; and other site specific data) and
    followed standard model setup and spinup procedures. The files also contain gap-filled
    observations and total uncertainty estimates. The data set was compiled for the
    North American Carbon Program (NACP) Site-Level Synthesis for use in model inter-comparison
    and assessment of how well the models simulate carbon processes across vegetation
    types and environmental conditions in North America. There is one compressed (.zip)
    file with this data set. When expanded, the .zip file contains model output data
    for one variable at one site. The model output and observations are available
    at the native half-hourly time step, or in daily, monthly, and annual aggregations,
    in comma-separated text (.csv) format.

  description: 'This data set provides the results of time-series analyses of Landsat
    imagery for 55 selected forested sites across the conterminous U.S.A. The output
    is a pair of disturbance data products for each site, one showing the first year
    of disturbance in the time series, the other showing the last year of disturbance.
    Each data pixel is labeled as either a static land class (persistent non-forest,
    persistent forest, or persistent water) or with the year of change for disturbed
    forest pixels. The time period analyzed is approximately 1984-2009.These forest
    disturbance data are distributed as a single band GeoTiff, with appropriate projection
    information defined within the file. The analyses were performed in three phases:
    5 sites during the Prototype/Focal phase; 23 sites in Phase I; and 27 sites in
    Phase II. The spatial resolution of the Prototype/Focal and Phase I data is 28.5
    meters. The spatial resolution of the Phase II data is 30 meters. The temporal
    resolution is nominally biennial. The mapped area for each forested site is approximately
    185 km x 185 km. There are a total of 110 GeoTiff files - a first year and a last
    year disturbance file for each of the 55 sites.'

  description: This data set contains the forcing data for Phase 1 of the North American
    Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-1). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing
    and range from Aug. 1996 to Dec. 2007. The temporal resolution is monthly. The
    file format is WMO GRIB-1. The NLDAS-1 monthly forcing data, containing 17 variables,
    are generated from the NLDAS-1 hourly forcing data. Brief description about the
    NLDAS-1 hourly forcing data can be found from the GCMD DIF for GES_DISC_NLDAS_FOR0125_H_V001
    at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_FOR0125_H_V001. The data
    set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter
    number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_FOR_monthly.001.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition
    Section (PDS) IDs and units. The variables, DLWRFsfc, DSWRFsfc, PRESsfc, SPFH2m,
    TMP2m, UGRD10m, and VGRD10m, are the monthly average from 00Z01 of month to 23:59Zlastdayofmonth.
    The variables, BRTMPsfc and CAPEsfc, are the monthly average from 00Z01 of month
    to 23:59Zlastdayofmonth, except if any hour has an undefined value of -9999, then
    do not include the hour in the monthly average. The variables, PARsfc and RGOESsfc,
    are the monthly average from 00Z01 of month to 23:59Zlastdayofmonth, except if
    any hour has an undefined value of -9999, then reassign the variable as zero and
    include the hour in the monthly average. The variables, ACPCPsfc, APCPsfc, PEDASsfc,
    and PRDARsfc, are the monthly accumulation from 00Z01 of month to 23:59Zlastdayofmonth.
    However, the ACPCPsfc is actually the sum of the (ACPCPsfc/PEDASsfc)*APCPsfc from
    each hour, where the ratio of (ACPCPsfc/PEDASsfc) is the fraction of convective
    precipitation from EDAS, and then multiplied by the APCPsfc to get the convective
    precipitation. For PRDARsfc accumulation, if hourly PRDARsfc is undefined or negative,
    fill the hour with a zero value. The last variable, RSWRFsfc, is the monthly average
    from 00Z01 of month to 23:59Zlastdayofmonth, except represents the monthly average
    of the hourly "blend" of the DSWRFsfc from EDAS and RGOESsfc from GEOS. The blend
    algorithm is that, for each hour, the RGOESsfc from GEOS is used for all the grid
    points where it is available, but for where it is not available, the DSWRFsfc
    from EDAS is used. Because the spatial extent/availability of GEOS varies from
    hour to hour, this blend is done for hourly data first, and then the monthly average
    is applied to the hourly blended data. This last variable thus best represents
    the shortwave radiation flux downwards at the surface that is used in the NLDAS-1
    LSMs. More about this blending/supplementation can be found from http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas/NLDAS1forcing.php.

  description: This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated
    from the Noah land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North American Land
    Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing
    and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is monthly. The
    file format is WMO GRIB-1. The NLDAS-2 monthly Noah model data were generated
    from the NLDAS-2 hourly Noah model data, as monthly accumulation for rainfall,
    snowfall, subsurface runoff, surface runoff, total evapotranspiration, and snow
    melt, and monthly average for other variables. Monthly period of each month is
    from 00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z at end of the month, except the first
    month (Jan 1979) that starts from 00Z 02 Jan 1979. Also for the first month (Jan
    1979), because the variables listed as instantaneous in the README file (http://hydro1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/s4pa/NLDAS/README.NLDAS2.pdf)
    do not have valid data exactly on 00Z 02 Jan 1979, and this one hour is not included

  description: This data set provides forest age map products at 1-km resolution for
    Canada and the United States (U.S.A.). These continental forest age maps were
    compiled from forest inventory data, historical fire data, optical satellite data,
    and the images from the NASA Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing
    System (LEDAPS) project. These input data products have various sources and creation
    dates as described in the source paper by Pan et al. (2011). Canadian maps were
    produced with data available through 2004 and U.S.A. maps with data available
    through 2006. A supplementary map of the standard deviations for age estimates
    was developed for quantifying uncertainty.Note that the Pan et al. (2011) paper
    is included as a companion file with this data set and was the source of descriptions
    in the guide.Forest age, implicitly reflecting the past disturbance legacy, is
    a simple and direct surrogate for the time since disturbance and may be used in
    various forest carbon analyses that concern the impact of disturbances. By combining
    geographic information about forest age with estimated carbon dynamics by forest
    type, it is possible to conduct a simple but powerful analysis of the net CO2
    uptake by forests, and the potential for increasing (or decreasing) this rate
    as a result of direct human intervention in the disturbance/age status.

  description: This monthly climatology data set contains a series of land surface
    parameters simulated from the Noah land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the
    North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th
    degree grid spacing. The temporal resolution is monthly, ranging from January
    to December. The NLDAS-2 monthly climatology data are the monthly data averaged
    over the thirty years (1980 - 2009) of the NLDAS-2 monthly data. The file format
    is WMO GRIB-1. Brief description about the NLDAS-2 hourly and monthly Noah LSM
    data can be found from the GCMD DIFs for GES_DISC_NLDAS_NOAH0125_H_V002 and GES_DISC_NLDAS_NOAH0125_M_V002
    at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_NOAH0125_H_V002 and http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_NOAH0125_M_V002.
    Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Noah LSM can be found in Xia et
    al. (2012). The NLDAS-2 Noah monthly climatology data contain fifty-two fields.
    The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and
    parameter number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_NOAH.002.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition

  description: This data set contains the monthly primary forcing data "File A" for
    Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data
    are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal
    resolution is monthly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. The NLDAS-2 monthly primary
    forcing data were generated from the NLDAS-2 hourly primary forcing data, as monthly
    accumulation for total precipitation, convective precipitation, and potential
    evaporation, and monthly average for other variables. The convective precipitation
    monthly total is the hourly convective fraction multiplied by the hourly precipitation
    (both from the NLDAS-2 "File A" files), and then summed over all hours of the
    month. Monthly period of each month is from 00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z
    at end of the month. The one exception to this is the first month (Jan. 1979)
    that starts from 00Z 02 Jan 1979, except for the monthly accumulated precipitation
    and convective precipitation that both start from 12Z 01 Jan 1979. Brief description
    about the NLDAS-2 hourly primary forcing data can be found from the GCMD DIF for
    GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORA0125_H_V002 at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORA0125_H_V002.
    Details about the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing datasets can be found in Xia
    et al. (2012). The monthly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped
    into two GRIB files, "File A" and "File B". "File A" is the primary (default)
    forcing file and contains eleven fields. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_FORA_monthly.002.txt)

  description: The data set provides a 30-m comprehensive fuelbed characteristics
    map for both the wildland and cropland areas of the conterminous United States
    (CONUS) for 2010. This integrated product is the result of combining the spatially
    discrete Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) data of the US Forest
    Service (USFS) with the crop-and grassland-specific information of the US Department
    of Agricultures (USDA's) Cropland Data Layer (CDL). By combining the spatially
    discrete details of the FCCS data set with the crop-and grassland-specific information
    of the CDL, a more robust map of fuelbed characteristics is available. The merged
    product has an advantage over the original FCCS map for estimating emissions from
    burned areas due to the integration of the fuelbed characteristics for agricultural
    areas from the CDL.There are three GeoTIFF format files and three comma-separated
    companion files distributed with this data set. The three tif files provided are
    very large and exceed the size limits of a standard GeoTIFF file format (4 GB).
    File sizes range from 20 to 30 GB. Compressed file sizes range from 2 to 3 GB.
    They are in a format that is called a BigTIFF file. ArcGIS 10.0 and ERDAS Imagine
    are able to read these files.

    (SMMR), the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) -F8, -F11 and -F13
    Special Sensor Microwave/Imagers (SSM/Is), and the DMSP-F17 Special Sensor Microwave
    Imager/Sounder (SSMIS). The data are provided in the polar stereographic projection
    at a grid cell size of 25 x 25 km. This product is designed to provide a consistent
    time series of sea ice concentrations (the fraction, or percentage, of ocean area
    covered by sea ice) spanning the coverage of several passive microwave instruments.
    To aid in this goal, sea ice algorithm coefficients are changed to reduce differences
    in sea ice extent and area as estimated using the SMMR and SSM/I sensors. The
    data are generated using the NASA Team algorithm developed by the Oceans and Ice
    Branch, Laboratory for Hydrospheric Processes at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
    (GSFC). These data include gridded daily (every other day for SMMR data) and monthly
    averaged sea ice concentrations for both the north and south polar regions. The
    data are produced at GSFC about once per year, with roughly a one-year latency,
    and include data since 26 October 1978. Data are produced from SMMR brightness
    temperature data processed at NASA GSFC and from SSM/I and SSMIS brightness temperature
    data processed at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Data are scaled
    and stored as one-byte integers in flat binary arrays. For each data file, a corresponding
    PNG browse image file is provided. Data are available via FTP.'

    (AOD) data sets represent a series of annual average grids (2001-2010) of fine
    particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from
    MODIS and MISR AOD satellite data. Together the grids provide a continuous surface
    of concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers
    or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. The satellite AOD retrievals
    were converted to ground-level concentrations based on a conversion factor developed
    by researchers at Dalhousie University that accounts for spatial and temporal
    variations in aerosol properties and vertical structure as derived from a global
    3 -D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The raster grids have a grid cell resolution
    of 30 arc-minutes (0.5 degree or approximately 50 sq. km at the equator) and cover
    the world from 70°N to 60°S latitude. The grids were produced by researchers at
    Battelle Memorial Institute in collaboration with the Center for International
    Earth Science Information Network/Columbia University under a NASA-ROSES project
    entitled "Using Satellite Data to Develop Environmental Indicators: An Application
    of NASA Data Products to Support High Level Decisions for National and International
    Environmental Protection". Exposure to fine particles is associated with premature
    death as well as increased morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular disease,
    especially in the elderly, young children, and those already suffering from these
    illnesses. The World Health Organization guideline for PM2.5 average annual exposure
    is less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms per cubic meter, whereas the US Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA) primary standard is less than or equal to 12.0 micrograms
    per cubic meter. The EPA primary standards are designed to protect public health
    with an adequate margin of safety.'

  description: This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated
    from the Mosaic land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North American Land
    Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing
    and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly. The
    file format is WMO GRIB-1. Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Mosaic
    LSM can be found in Xia et al. (2012). Mosaic was developed by Koster and Suarez
    (1994, 1996) to account for subgrid vegetation variability with a tile approach.
    Each vegetation tile carries its own energy and water balance and soil moisture
    and temperature. Each tile has three soil layers, with the first two in the root
    zone. In NLDAS, Mosaic is configured to support a maximum of 10 tiles per grid
    cell with a 5% cutoff that ignores vegetation classes covering less than 5% of
    the cell. Additionally in NLDAS, all tiles of Mosaic in a grid cell have a predominant
    soil type and three soil layers with fixed thickness values of 10, 30, and 160
    cm (hence constant rooting depth of 40 cm and constant total column depth of 200
    cm). The Mosaic LSM was forced by the hourly NLDAS-2 forcing "File A" files, and
    contains thirty-seven fields. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table
    to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_MOS.002.txt)

  description: This data set contains the forcing data for Phase 1 of the North American
    Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-1). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing
    and range from 29 Sep 1996 to 31 Dec 2007. The temporal resolution is hourly.
    The file format is WMO GRIB-1. The chief source of NLDAS-1 forcing is NCEP's Eta
    model-based Data Assimilation System (EDAS) [Rogers et al., 1995], a continuously
    cycled North American 4DDA system. It utilizes 3-hourly analysis-forecast cycles
    to derive atmospheric states by assimilating many types of observations, including
    station observations of surface pressure and screen-level atmospheric temperature,
    humidity, and U and V wind components. EDAS 3-hourly fields of the latter five
    variables plus surface downward shortwave and longwave radiation and total and
    convective precipitation are provided on a 40-km grid, and then interpolated spatially
    to the NLDAS grid and temporally to one hour. Last, to account for NLDAS versus
    EDAS surface-elevation differences, a terrain-height adjustment is applied to
    the air temperature and surface pressure using a standard lapse rate (6.5 K/km),
    then to specific humidity (keeping original relative humidity) and downward longwave
    radiation (for new air temperature, specific humidity). The details of the spatial
    interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are presented
    by Cosgrove et al. (2003). GOES-based solar insolation (Pinker et al., 2003) provides
    the primary insolation forcing (shorwave down at the surface) for NLDAS-1. GOES
    insolation is not retrieved for zenith angles below 75 degrees and so is supplemented
    with EDAS insolation near the day/night terminator. Last from the GOES-based product
    suite, Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and surface brightness temperature
    fields are included in the NLDAS-1 forcing files. NLDAS-1 precipitation forcing
    over CONUS is anchored to NCEP's 1/4th degree gauge-only daily precipitation analyses
    of Higgins et al. [2000]. In NLDAS-1, this daily analysis is interpolated to 1/8th
    degree, then temporally disaggregated to hourly values by applying hourly weights
    derived from hourly, 4-km, radar-based (WSR-88D) precipitation fields. The latter
    radar-based fields are used only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change
    the daily total precipitation. Last, convective precipitation is estimated by
    multiplying NLDAS-1 total precipitation by the ratio of EDAS convective to EDAS
    total precipitation. The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is the final
    variable in the forcing data set, also interpolated from EDAS. The data set applies
    a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number.
