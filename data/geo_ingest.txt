    Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) Passive Microwave Data. This data set contains four zip
    files which includes sea ice concentration (in percentage of ocean area covered
    by sea ice), table data and map data. These original data were re-gridded by the
    National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) from their original 25-km spatial resolution
    and EASE-Grid into equal angle Earth grids with quarter, half and one degree spatial
    resolutions in latitude/longitude. The ISLSCP II staff have taken the one degree
    resolution original data provided by the Principal Investigator and created global
    maps of monthly sea ice concentration on a global one degree grid using the latitude
    and longitude coordinates that were provided. Individual monthly files were created
    and written to the ASCII format. The re-gridded one degree original data were
    also adjusted to match the one degree ISLSCP II land/water mask.'

  description: 'A station observation-based global land monthly mean surface air temperature
    dataset at 0.5 x 0.5 latitude-longitude resolution for the period from 1948 to
    the present was developed at the Climate Prediction Center, National Centers for
    Environmental Prediction. This data set is different from some existing surface
    air temperature data sets in: (1) using a combination of two large individual
    data sets of station observations collected from the Global Historical Climatology
    Network version 2 and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System (GHCN + CAMS), so
    it can be regularly updated in near real time with plenty of stations and (2)
    some unique interpolation methods, such as the anomaly interpolation approach
    with spatially-temporally varying temperature lapse rates derived from the observation-based
    Reanalysis for topographic adjustment. When compared with several existing observation-based
    land surface air temperature data sets, the preliminary results show that the
    quality of this new GHCN + CAMS land surface air temperature analysis is reasonably
    good and the new data set can capture most common temporal-spatial features in
    the observed climatology and anomaly fields over both regional and global domains.
    The study also reveals that there are clear biases between the observed surface
    air temperature and the existing Reanalysis data sets, and they vary in space
    and seasons. Therefore the Reanalysis 2 m temperature data sets may not be suitable
    for model forcing and validation. The GHCN + CAMS data set will be mainly used
    as one of land surface meteorological forcing inputs to derive other land surface
    variables, such as soil moisture, evaporation, surface runoff, snow accumulation
    and snow melt, etc. As a byproduct, this monthly mean surface air temperature
    data set can also be applied to monitor surface air temperature variations over
    global land routinely or to verify the performance of model simulation and prediction.

  _identifier: C196280696-GSFCS4PA
  _poc_org: National Aeronautics and Space Administration
  description: This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated
    from the Noah land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North American Land
    Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing
    and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly. The
    file format is WMO GRIB-1. Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Noah
    LSM can be found in Xia et al. (2012). The Noah model was developed as the land
    component of the NOAA NCEP mesoscale Eta model [Betts et al. (1997); Chen et al.
    (1997); Ek et al. (2003)]. As used in NLDAS-2, recent modifications were made
    to Noah's cold-season [Livneh et al. (2010)] and warm-season [Wei et al. (2012)]
    parameterizations. Noah serves as the land component in the evolving Weather Research
    and Forecasting (WRF) regional atmospheric model, the NOAA NCEP coupled Climate
    Forecast System (CFS), and the Global Forecast System (GFS). The model simulates
    the soil freeze-thaw process and its impact on soil heating/cooling and transpiration,
    following Koren et al. (1999). The model has four soil layers with spatially invariant
    thicknesses of 10, 30, 60, and 100 cm. The first three layers form the root zone
    in non-forested regions, with the fourth layer included in forested regions. The
    Noah LSM was forced by the hourly NLDAS-2 forcing "File A" files, and contains
    fifty-two fields. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate
    the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_NOAH.002.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition
    Section (PDS) IDs and units. For information about the vertical layers of the
    Soil Moisture Content (PDS 086), Soil Temperature (PDS 085), and Liquid Soil Moisture

  description: 'This data set provides monthly burned area, and monthly, and annual
    fire emissions data from July 1996 to February 2012. Emissions data are available
    for carbon (C), dry matter (DM), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane
    (CH4), hydrogen (H2), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane
    hydrocarbons (NMHC), organic carbon (OC), black carbon (BC), particulate matter
    2.5 micron (PM2p5), total particulate matter (TPM), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).
    The C4 fraction of carbon emissions is also provided. The annual C emissions estimates
    were derived by combining burned area data with a biogeochemical model, CASA-Global
    Fire Emissions Database (CASA-GFED), that estimates fuel loads and combustion
    completeness for each monthly time step. The fuel loads were based on satellite
    derived information on vegetation characteristics and productivity to estimate
    carbon input and carbon outputs through heterotrophic respiration, herbivory,
    and fires. Note that while most emissions estimates included data for 32 variables
    (trace gases, aerosols, and carbon), not all data are available for all years,
    and not all variables (emission species) are included in each data product.Additional
    information may be obtained from the Global Fire Data website: http://www.globalfiredata.org/index.html.
    Data products include:- 0.5 degree x 0.5 degree gridded monthly burned area data
    (ha) for 1996 to 2012 provided as text files and as GeoTIFF files for 1996 to
    2012.- 3-Hourly emssions (fraction) for 2003 to 2010 in NetCDF (.nc) format.-
    Daily emssions (fraction) for 2003 to 2010, in NetCDF (.nc) format.- Monthly emissions
    for 32 variables from 1997 to 2011, in text and GeoTIFF format.- Monthly emissions
    for 31 variables from specific sources (grassland and savanna, woodland, deforestation
    & degradation, forest, agricultural waste burning, and peat fires), both as absolute
    and relative emissions. The time period is for 2007 to 2011, and the files are
    provided in text and GeoTIFF format.- Global emission totals of C and other species
    from all sources, and from each individual source (forest fires, peat fires, agricultural
    waste burning, etc).- Annual emissions of carbon and other trace gases for all
    countries, for the period 1997 to 2010, provided as text files. These files are
    for indicative use only; they are not suitable for official reporting due to large
    uncertainties and potential for missing key regional aspects in the global approach
    used.- Ancillary data for monthly biosphere fluxes. The CASA-GFED biosphere flux
    sources include Net Primary Production (NPP), Heterotrophic respiration (Rh),
    and fires (biomass burning). These files are for the time period 1997 to 2009
    and are provided as text files and in GeoTIFF format.'

    Primary data from CEAREX are available on FTP in ASCII format along with some
    data from the Marginal Ice Zone Experiment (MIZEX) and the Eurasian Basin Experiment
    (EUBEX). Meteorology data from CEAREX and the MIZEX (1983, 1984, 1987) include
    near-surface time series and rawinsonde (upper-air sounding) profiles of wind,
    pressure, temperature, and humidity collected on ship platforms and ice floe stations.
    A collection of hydrography data include CTD, STD, and bottle data from a ship
    and two operations camps. Hydrography data also include data from the MIZEX, the
    EUBEX, NODC archives, and a merged set of data from five other cruises. Sea ice
    data consist of compressive stress measurements made in a multi-year floe, stress
    sensor data for time series of stress invariants, and ice accelerometer data for
    movements associated with the deformation of multi-year ice floes. Noise data
    consist of acoustic measurements from a variety of hydrophone and geophone arrays,
    and ambient noise observations from a ship using omni-directional hydrophones
    tethered beneath the ice cover. Biophysical data include bottle sample, zooplankton
    sampling, and bioluminescence data. Bathymetry data consist of gridded trackline
    data collected from the two operations camps, and digital bottom bathymetry and
    continental topography data for the Fram Strait region and a portion of the Arctic
    Ocean. Sample position data consist of hourly listings of position and velocity
    for both manned stations and unmanned drifting buoys. Data are available via FTP.

  description: The North America Regional Reanalysis (NARR) Project is a reanalysis
    of historical observations using a 32-km version of the National Centers for Environmental
    Prediction (NCEP) 1993 operational ETA model and ETA data assimilation system
    (EDAS). The objective is to create a long-term set of consistent climate data
    on a regional scale for the North American domain. The domain of analyses includes
    North and Central America as well as small parts of the United Kingdom, Eastern
    Asia, South America, and areas of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The period
    of the reanalyses is from October 1978 to the present and analyses were made 8
    times daily (3 hour intervals). Horizontal boundary conditions are derived from
    the NCEP/DOE Global Reanalysis. Advantages over the widely used NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis
    (180 km) are its higher spatial and temporal resolutions (32 km grid, 45 vertical
    layers, every three hours) and better treatment of the land surface. This is achieved
    through the use of a better land-surface model (Noah LSM), the assimilation of
    more observational data (precipitation, upper air and surface winds), and through
    a better representation of the terrain (heights, vegetation, soil type). This
    data set contains "conventional" atmospheric analyses as well as model-derived
    fields that contain estimates of subsurface, surface, and radiative properties.
    This data set is encoded in WMO GRIB format version 1 using the NCEP GRIB table
    131. The model used a native, "E-grid" for its calculations, however data were
    interpolated to a Lambert Conformal Conic projection, also known as NAM 221 AWIPS
    Grid - High Resolution North American Master Grid (32-km Resolution). All vector
    components are earth relative rather than grids relative which is the convention
    for operational NCEP model. The list of fields produced by the NARR ETA model
    differ from the operational ETA model. NARR data files that are compatible with
    the Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) are available.

  description: 'The goal of the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) is to
    ingest satellite- and ground-based observational data products, using advanced
    land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques, in order to generate optimal
    fields of land surface states and fluxes (Rodell et al., 2004a). The software,
    which has been streamlined and parallelized by the Land Information System (LIS)
    sister project, drives multiple, offline (not coupled to the atmosphere) land
    surface models, integrates a huge quantity of observation based data, executes
    globally at high resolutions (2.5-degrees to 1 km), and is capable of producing
    results in near-real time. A vegetation-based tiling approach is used to simulate
    sub-grid scale variability, with a 1-km global vegetation dataset as its basis.
    Soil and elevation parameters are based on high resolution global datasets. Observation-based
    precipitation and downward radiation products and the best available analyses
    from atmospheric data assimilation systems are employed to force the models. Intercomparison
    and validation of these products is being performed with the aim of identifying
    an optimal forcing scheme. Data assimilation techniques for incorporating satellite
    based hydrological products, including snow cover and water equivalent, soil moisture,
    surface temperature, and leaf area index, are now being implemented as part of
    a follow-on project funded by the NASA Energy and Water Cycle Study (NEWS) Initiative.
    The high-quality, global land surface fields provided by GLDAS support several
    current and proposed weather and climate prediction, water resources applications,
    and water cycle investigations. The project has resulted in a massive archive
    of modeled and observed, global, surface meteorological data, parameter maps,
    and output which includes 1-degree and 0.25-degree resolution 1979-present simulations
    of the Noah, CLM, VIC, and Mosaic land surface models. For more information visit:

    topographic maps for Alaska. AMI coordinates Federal activities through the Alaska
    Mapping Executive Committee (AMEC) and State efforts through Alaska's Statewide
    Digital Mapping Initiative (SDMI) to ensure a unified approach for consistent
    data acquisition and enhancement of elevation data products. AMI attained interferometric
    synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) to generate digital elevation model (DEM) data.
    This radar mapping technology is an effective tool for collecting data in challenging
    circumstances such as cloud cover, extreme weather conditions, rugged terrain,
    and remote locations. Airborne IFSAR data were flown over South Central Alaska
    in the summer of 2010 and over Northwest Alaska in 2012.

  description: These rasters represent output from the Boreal ALFRESCO (Alaska Frame
    Based Ecosystem Code) model. Boreal ALFRESCO operates on an annual time step,
    in a landscape composed of 1 x 1 km pixels, a scale appropriate for interfacing
    with mesoscale climate and carbon models. The last four digits of the file name
    specifies the year represented by the raster. For example a file named Age_years_historical_1990.tif
    represents the year 1990. Cell values represent the age of vegetation in years
    since last fire, with zero (0) indicating burned area in that year. Coverage of
    this dataset includes much of the state of Alaska (but does exclude Southeastern
    AK, Kodiak Island, portions of the Alaska Peninsula, and the Aleutian Islands).
    ALFRESCO simulates the responses of subarctic and boreal vegetation to transient
    climatic changes. The model assumptions reflect the hypothesis that fire regime
    and climate are the primary drivers of landscape-level changes in the distribution
    of vegetation in the circumpolar arctic/boreal zone. Furthermore, it assumes that
    vegetation composition and continuity serve as a major determinant of large, landscape-level
    fires. Files from years 1860-2006 use a variety of historical datasets for model
    spin up and calibration to most closely match historical wildfire dynamics. Files
    from years 2007-2099 use the Hadley (HAD_CM3) Global Climate model and the A1B
    emissions scenario for projecting future vegetation ages. The HAD_CM3 model was
    chosen based on it being the mean predictor of climate.

  description: Hydrologic landscape regions (HLRs) in the United States were delineated
    by using geographic information system (GIS) tools and statistical methods including
    principal components and cluster analyses. The GIS and statistical analyses were
    applied to land-surface form, geologic texture (permeability of the soil and bedrock),
    and climate variables that describe the physical and climatic setting of 43,931
    small (roughly 200 square kilometers) watersheds in the United States. The analyses
    then grouped the watersheds into 20 noncontiguous regions (the HLRs) on the basis
    of similarities in land-surface form, geologic texture, and climate characteristics.
    This hydrologic landscape regions dataset contains for each of the 43,931 watersheds
    the (1) watershed identification number, (2) land-surface form, geologic texture,
    and climate characteristics for each watershed, and (3) hydrologic landscape region

  description: This NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT)
    is derived from data taken over global oceans from the PATMOS-x AVHRR level-2b
    channel 1 (0.63 micron) orbital clear-sky radiance. The retrieval is performed
    for selected spatial (8-km) and temporal (1 time per day) resolution in cloud
    free condition during daytime over global oceans. The AVHRR AOT CDR version 2
    extends from 1981 to 2009 and includes both daily and monthly data in an equal
    angle grid (0.1x0.1 degree). Version 2 has improved cloud screening and data processing
    from version 1. Due to the relatively large uncertainties associated with surface
    reflectance over water glint area and land surface as well as limited AVHRR retrieval
    channels, the current algorithm only performs retrieval over non-glint water surface
    (specifically at the anti-solar side of the orbit and viewing angle is larger
    than 40 degree away from the specular ray).

  description: This data set provides sea ice extent for the Arctic (60-90 degrees
    North) and Antarctic (52-90 degrees South) in Scatterometer Image Reconstruction
    (SIR) binary image format, along with ASCII text files containing latitude and
    longitude coordinates along the sea ice edge, and browse images of SIR files in
    Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format. Ancillary products include daily-averaged
    total sea ice extent in ASCII format. Estimates of sea ice extent were produced
    from daily-averaged QuikSCAT sigma-0 measurements and extend from 19 July 1999
    to 31 December 2004. QuikSCAT obtains 12 individual radar normalized backscatter
    (sigma-0) measurements, called slices, for each footprint as it scans over a 1800
    km wide swath. Slices are typically 4 to 6 km long by 20 km wide. The summed measurements
    of the slices are called egg measurements. The effective resolution and shape
    of each egg measurement is approximately 20 by 30 km, depending on the antenna
    beam and instrument mode. This data set contains both slice and egg images for
    each day. The Microwave Earth Remote Sensing (MERS) group at Brigham Young University
    (BYU) developed a SIR-with-filtering (SIRF) algorithm that combines forward- and
    aft-looking sigma-0 measurements to produce enhanced-resolution backscatter images
    over various azimuth angles. The polarization ratio, incidence angle dependence,
    and the sigma-0 estimate error standard deviation were used to discriminate between
    sea ice and ocean. Sea ice extent was estimated for both slice and egg images.
    The nominal pixel resolution of the slice images is 2.225 km with an estimated
    effective resolution of approximately 4 km. Egg images have a nominal pixel resolution
    of 4.45 km with an estimated effective resolution of approximately 8 to 10 km.

  description: 'ClimoBase is a collection of surface climate measurements collected
    in Northern Canada by Dr. Wayne Rouse between 1984 and 1998 in three locations:
    Churchill, Manitoba; Marantz Lake, Manitoba; and Inuvik, Northwest Territories.
    These data are comprised of surface-climate measurements, including solar time,
    wind speed, wind direction, dry-bulb, wet-bulb, and vapor pressure in 24 sites
    focused at the three Northern Canadian locations. The sites were chosen to include
    a variety of terrains in the study: sedge fen wetland, willow-birch wetland, lichen-heath,
    bedrock boulders/heath, spruce- tamarack forest, tundra lake, creek, various (e.g.
    a basin: sedge, willow, lichen-heath, forest, etc.), sparse vegetation (short
    grass/sedge, heath spp.), and coastal marsh (tall grass, sandy soils).The measurements
    were taken in increments ranging from seasonally to every 15 minutes. In all,
    177 different variables were measured and recorded. The data are valuable due
    to their unique and consistent nature.ClimoBase was created to provide a central
    repository for Dr. Wayne Rouse''s raw field data. Dr. Rouse is now Professor Emeritus
    at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario. Dr. Rouse was considered by the Canadian
    Association of Geographers (CAG) to have "pioneered field research on the evaporation
    of high latitude sites, including woodlands, tundra, wetland and lake surfaces"
    (1998). He received the 1998 CAG Award for Scholarly Distinction in Geography.
    In 2001, Dr. Roger Barry, the Director of NSIDC at the time, received a copy of
    ClimoBase for NSIDC. We are publishing these data now as part of an effort to
    help assure the preservation of small data collections that are not part of a
    larger funded program, and that may receive wider use through documentation and
    distribution on line.'

  description: Water level records are a combination of the fluctuations of the ocean
    and the vertical land motion at the location of the station. Monthly mean sea
    level (MSL) variations were analyzed for 128 stations of the National Ocean Service's
    (NOS) National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) having between 30 and 146
    years of data. The sea level variations determined are the linear trend, the average
    seasonal cycle, and the interannual variability at each station. Monthly data
    up to the end of 2006 were used in the calculation and all stations had data spanning
    a period of 30 years or more. Since the derived trends include the local vertical
    land motion, they are spatially variable. Calculated MSL trends range from 9.85
    mm/yr for Grand Isle, LA to -16.68 mm/yr for Skagway AK, and are consistent with
    previous trends published by NOS. Available data from this project include time
    series plots for each station of the monthly MSL with the seasonal cycle removed,
    a 5-month average, and the linear trend with its 95% confidence interval which
    was obtained after accounting for the average seasonal cycle; the seasonal cycle;
    the Interannual variation of mean sea level for all data to 2006; and the Interannual
    variation from 1980 to the present (updated monthly). The location and timing
    of any major earthquakes near stations in tectonically-active areas are noted
    since an associated vertical offset or a change in MSL trend is possible.

    at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). The Integrated Surface Data (ISD)
    database is composed of worldwide surface weather observations from over 20,000
    stations, collected and stored from sources such as the Automated Weather Network
    (AWN), the Global Telecommunications System (GTS), the Automated Surface Observing
    System (ASOS), and data keyed from paper forms. Most digital observations are
    decoded either at operational centers and forwarded to the Federal Climate Complex
    (FCC) in Asheville, NC, or decoded at the FCC. The US Air Force Combat Climatology
    Center (AFCCC), the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), and the US Navy''s Fleet
    Numerical Meteorological and Oceanographical Command Detachment (FNMOD), make
    up the FCC in Asheville. Each agency is responsible for data ingest, quality control,
    and customer support for surface climatological data. All data are now stored
    in a single ASCII format. Numerous DOD and civilian customers use this database
    in climatological applications. ISD refers to the digital database and format
    in which hourly and synoptic (3-hourly) weather observations are stored. The format
    conforms to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The database includes
    data originating from various codes such as synoptic, airways, METAR (Meteorological
    Routine Weather Report), and SMARS (Supplementary Marine Reporting Station), as
    well as observations from automatic weather stations. The data are sorted by station-year-month-day-hour-minute.
    Parameters included are: air quality, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature/dew
    point, atmospheric winds, clouds, precipitation, ocean waves, tides and more.
    ISD Version 1 was released in 2001, with Version 2 (additional quality control
    applied) in 2003. Since 2003, there have been continued incremental improvements
    in automated quality control software.'

    Prediction (NCEP) for producing weather forecasts. Dozens of weather parameters
    are available from the NAM grids, from temperature and precipitation to lightning
    and turbulent kinetic energy. The NAM generates multiple grids (or domains) of
    weather forecasts over the North American continent at various horizontal resolutions.
    High-resolution forecasts are generated within the NAM using additional numerical
    weather models. These high-resolution forecast windows are generated over fixed
    regions and are occasionally run to follow significant weather events, like hurricanes.
    This dataset contains a 12 km horizontal resolution Lambert Conformal grid covering
    the Continental United States (CONUS) domain. It is run four times daily at 00z,
    06z, 12z and 18z out to 84 hours with a 1 hour temporal resolution.

    Conservation Service Soil Survey Geographic Database (NRCS SSURGO), the 2006 National
    Land Cover Database (NLCD), and the USDA's 2010 Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Because
    these data are based on SSURGO map units' percent hydric there are four thresholds
    used to classify if a particular map unit would be hydric. These thresholds are
    20%, 40%, 60% and 80%, where a map unit area that had a value of 42% for the SSURGO
    hydric measurement (based on the raster dataset named "sum_comppct_r2_hydric")
    would be considered non-hydric under the 60% threshold but hydric under both the
    20% and 40% thresholds. For this dataset, the threshold of 80% is used. This dataset

  description: This dataset consists of a mosaic created from an Interferometric Synthetic
    Aperture Radar (IfSAR) derived digital surface model (DSM) acquired over the National
    Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) in northern Alaska between 07/2002 and 09/2006.
    The primary IFSAR dataset was acquired by Intermap Technologies and contracted
    by the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Science
    Foundation. The raw data were collected with a STAR-3i airborne synthetic aperture
    radar system, a high-resolution, single pass, across track IfSAR system (Intermap,
    2010). The Digital Surface Model (DSM) products represent the first reflective
    surface as illuminated by the radar. The STAR-3i system is capable of acquiring
    imagery with a horizontal accuracy better than 2 m, a vertical accuracy better
    than 1 m, and a vertical resolution on the order of 0.1 m (Intermap, 2010). Accuracy
    statements are based on areas of moderate terrain. Diminished accuracies are to
    be expected in areas of extreme terrain and dense vegetation. In addition, the
    DSM contains processing artifacts expressing as 30 to 50 cm high ripples or 'corn
    rows' that should be considered additional vertical error in the dataset. This
    striping results from uncompensated differential phase errors on very flat terrain.
    In addition, users will notice a seam line separating the tiles that were provided
    in UTM zone 5 with those provided in UTM zone 4. The differences along the seamline
    is within the 1m vertical accuracy of the dataset butthe variability is apparent
    here. The DSM data for 7.5-minute by 18-minute units correspond to the USGS 1:63,360
    scale topographic quadrangle map series for available areas in the United States.
    Each 7.5-minute by 18-minute tile provides full coverage with overlap into adjacent
    tiles. The mosaic consists of 312 tiles. The mosaic was created using the software
    package Global Mapper and exported as an Erdas Imagine image file. The IFSAR tiles
    comprising the mosaic consist of bara1nw, bara1se, bara1sw, bara2ne, bara2nw,

  description: The national agricultural water demand metric provides insight into
    the amount of water currently used for agricultural irrigation in the contiguous
    United States. The values are based on 2005 irrigation water use; combined 2010
    crop, 2006 land use, and 2001 remotely sensed irrigation location estimates; and
    have been summarized by watershed or 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC). Agricultural
    irrigation water use, as defined in this case, meets a variety of needs before,
    during, and after growing seasons (e.g., dust suppression, field preparation,
    chemical application, weed control, salt removal from root zones, frost protection,
    crop cooling, and harvesting). Estimates include self-supplied surface and groundwater,
    as well as supplies from irrigation-specific organizations (e.g., companies, districts,
    cooperatives, government). This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support
    research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas)

  description: The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Downloadable Data Collection
    from The National Map (TNM) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that
    encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface
    water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals,
    ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs,
    wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes
    classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position
    and related measures, a "reach code" through which other information can be related
    to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating
    water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream
    and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset
    contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements
    to the data. The NHD supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding
    observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional
    information on NHD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/.

  description: '<p>The Daily Air Temperature and Heat Index data available on CDC
    WONDER are county-level daily average air temperatures and heat index measures
    spanning the years 1979-2010. Temperature data are available in Fahrenheit or
    Celsius scales. Reported measures are the average temperature, number of observations,
    and range for the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, and also percent
    coverage for the daily maximum heat index. Data are available by place (combined
    48 contiguous states, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day)
    and specified maximum and minimum air temperature, and heat index value. The data
    are derived from the North America Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) through
    NLDAS Phase 2, a collaboration project among several groups: the National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction
    (NCEP) Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), the National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Princeton University,
    the National Weather Service (NWS) Office of Hydrological Development (OHD), the
    University of Washington, and the NCEP Climate Prediction Center (CPC). In a study
    funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program/Public Health Program, scientists
    at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center/ Universities Space Research Association
    developed the analysis to produce the data available on CDC WONDER.</p>'

  description: There are critical needs for a nationwide compilation of reliable shoreline
    data. To meet these needs, the USGS has produced a comprehensive database of digital
    vector shorelines by compiling shoreline positions from pre-existing historical
    shoreline databases and by generating historical and modern shoreline data. Historical
    shoreline positions serve as easily understood features that can be used to describe
    the movement of beaches through time. These data are used to calculate rates of
    shoreline change for the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Assessment of
    Shoreline Change Project. Each shoreline may represent a compilation of data from
    one or more sources for one or more dates provided by one or more agencies. Details
    regarding source are provided in the 'Data Quality Information' section of the
    individual shoreline metadata report. To make this shoreline data more accessible
    to the public and other agencies, the USGS created this web service. This web
    service was created utilizing ESRI ArcServer. Vector shoreline layers were collected,
    organized by state, and symbology made consistent among similar data sets. This
    service meets open geospatial consortium standards.

  description: This data set represents basin characteristics, compiled for every
    catchment in NHDPlus for the conterminous United States. These characteristics
    are basin shape index, stream density, sinuosity, mean elevation, mean slope,
    and number of road-stream crossings. The source data sets are the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency's NHDPlus and the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER/Line Files. The
    NHDPlus Version 1.1 is an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial datasets
    that incorporates many of the best features of the National Hydrography Dataset
    (NHD) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus includes a stream
    network (based on the 1:100,00-scale NHD), improved networking, naming, and value-added
    attributes (VAAs). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage
    areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first widely used in New
    England, and thus referred to as "the New England Method." This technique involves
    "burning in" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available building "walls" using
    the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital
    elevation model (HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree
    with the NHD and WBD. Over the past two years, an interdisciplinary team from
    the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (USEPA), and contractors, found that this method produces the best quality NHD
    catchments using an automated process (USEPA, 2007). The NHDPlus dataset is organized
    by 18 Production Units that cover the conterminous United States. The NHDPlus
    version 1.1 data are grouped by the U.S. Geologic Survey's Major River Basins
    (MRBs, Crawford and others, 2006). MRB1, covering the New England and Mid-Atlantic
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 1 and 2. MRB2, covering the South
    Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 3
    and 6. MRB3, covering the Great Lakes, Ohio, Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 4, 5, 7 and 9. MRB4, covering
    the Missouri River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 10-lower and 10-upper.
    MRB5, covering the Lower Mississippi, Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River
    basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 8, 11 and 12. MRB6, covering the Rio
    Grande, Colorado and Great Basin River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units
    13, 14, 15 and 16. MRB7, covering the Pacific Northwest River basins, contains
    NHDPlus Production Unit 17. MRB8, covering California River basins, contains NHDPlus
    Production Unit 18.

  description: 'The AEWC dataset was created using a new algorithm developed by researchers
    at Georgia Tech and represents the first attempt to produce a standard easterly
    wave tracking dataset for the East Pacific, Atlantic, and Africa. The algorithm
    uses curvature vorticity anomalies to identify the location of easterly waves
    as a function of time. The dataset provides 6-hourly coverage over a 63-year period
    (January 1948-December 2010) in the region bounded by 35S-35N x 140W-40E. Data
    files are derived using four separate atmospheric reanalysis products including:
    1) the ERA-40 dataset (covers the period January 1958 to December 2001); 2) the
    ERA-Interim dataset (covers the period January 1979 to December 2010); the CFS-R
    dataset (covers the period January 1979 to December 2010); and the NCEP/NCAR I
    dataset (covers the period January 1948 to December 2010). Other data sources
    used in the production of the AEWC are the Remote Sensing Systems SSM/I Total
    Precipitable Water, Rain Rate, and Cloud Liquid Water content products, Claus
    Brightness Temperature, and Outgoing Longwave Radiation from the NCDC Daily OLR
    CDR. Each netCDF file contains all the easterly waves that originate in a given
    year, the isobaric level for easterly wave tracking (600hPa, 700hPa, and 850hPa)
    and the zone from which the easterly wave began its development. Zones include:
    Africa (AFR), Central America (CAM), North Atlantic (NAL), Northeast Pacific (NEP),
    South Atlantic (SAL), South America (SAM), Southeast Pacific (SEP), and Other
    (OTH). For each easterly wave, the following variables are provided including:
    wave observation count, wave trajectory id, wave time, wave trough centroid latitude,
    wave trough centroid longitude, wave trough maximum latitude, mean longitude of
    wave trough maximum latitude, wave trough minimum latitude, mean longitude of

  description: 'This data set contains the secondary forcing data &quot;File B&quot;
    for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The
    data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present.
    The temporal resolution is hourly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. Details about
    the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing datasets can be found in Xia et al. (2012).
    The non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from
    the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). NARR
    analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.
    Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially
    interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally
    disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency. NLDAS-2 is providing a second forcing
    file, &quot;File B&quot;, in which the surface temperature, humidity, and wind
    fields are represented not at 2-meters and 10-meters above the height of the NLDAS
    terrain, but rather at the same height above the NLDAS terrain as the height above
    the NARR terrain of the lowest prognostic level of the NARR assimilation system
    (namely, the same height above the model terrain as the lowest prognostic level
    of the mesoscale Eta model, which is the assimilating model in NARR). The surface
    downward surface radiation field in &quot;File B&quot; is taken directly from
    NARR, without any bias correction. The precipitation and convective precipitation
    fields in &quot;File B&quot; are also taken directly from NARR, and are used to
    calculate the convective fraction provided in &quot;File A&quot;. The aerodynamic
    conductance is &quot;File B&quot; is also taken from NARR. The hourly land surface
    forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two GRIB files, &quot;File A&quot;
    and &quot;File B&quot;. &quot;File B&quot; is the secondary (optional) forcing
    file and contains ten fields. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table
    to indicate the contents and parameter number. The following table shows a list

  description: The State of the Climate is a collection of periodic summaries recapping
    climate-related occurrences on both a global and national scale. The State of
    the Climate Monthly Overview - National Snow & Ice report provides an analysis
    of snow and ice in the United States, placing the data into a historical perspective.
    Topics include snow cover extent and snowpack; the period of record for snow cover
    extent is 1967 to the present. Significant events and storms are also covered.
    Reports are generated monthly for all snow months in the U.S. (October-April,
    occasionally September and May) beginning with October 2002. Additional annual
    analyses focused on the July through June Northern Hemisphere "snow season", as
    opposed to the calendar year, are available beginning in 2008.

  description: 'The burn area and severity data were stochastically generated using
    a probabilistic ignition model and mechanistic fire-spread model. The ignition
    model consisted of a general linear model with a binary response, constructed
    by relating daily ignition locations in the monitoring trends in burn severity
    database (MTBS; Eidenshink et al 2007) to predictor variables including daily
    weather, fuel moisture, fire behavior indices, monthly and seasonal climate variables,
    and vegetation and land cover. In the simulations, the ignition model was used
    to stochastically generate ignition locations. After a location was generated,
    fires were spread using the minimum-travel time algorithm (MTT; Finney 2002) which
    generates spatially-explicit burn scars in relation to weather and fuel moisture
    conditions, fuels, and topography. Simulations were first calibrated using historic,
    observed weather data from 1984-2008 (Maurer et al. 2002) and then future projections
    were made using downscaled GCM data (Maurer et al. 2007). For this assessment,
    the climate change projections included data produced by the CCCma CGCM 3.1, CSIRO–Mk3.0,
    MIROC 3.2-medres GCMs for the A1B, A2, and B1 scenarios. Fuels and vegetation
    data were provided by the LANDFIRE project (Rollins 2008). Detailed information

  description: U.S. 15 Minute Precipitation Data is digital data set DSI-3260, archived
    at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). This is precipitation data. The primary
    source of data for this file is approximately 2,000 mostly U.S. weather stations
    operated or managed by the U.S. National Weather Service. Stations are primary,
    secondary, or cooperative observer sites that have the capability to measure precipitation
    at 15 minute intervals. This dataset contains 15-minute precipitation data (reported
    4 times per hour, if precip occurs) for U.S. stations along with selected non-U.S.
    stations in U.S. territories and associated nations. It includes major city locations
    and many small town locations. Daily total precipitation is also included as part
    of the data record. NCDC has in archive data from most states as far back as 1970
    or 1971, and continuing to the present day. The major parameter is precipitation
    amounts at 15 minute intervals, when precipitation actually occurs.

  description: 'This is a map service for the Coastal Flood Hazard Composite dataset.
    This dataset was created by combining hazard zones from the following datasets:
    FEMA V zones, FEMA A zones, FEMA shaded X zones, NOAA OCM Flood Frequency zones,
    NOAA OCM potential sea level rise inundation of 3 ft above current Mean Higher
    High Water (MHHW), and SLOSH MOMs for category 3 hurricanes. This dataset was
    created to support the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office
    for Coastal Management''s pilot version of the Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper.
    The purpose of the online mapping tool is to provide coastal managers, planners,
    and stakeholders a preliminary look at exposures to coastal flooding hazards.
    The Mapper is a screening-level tool that uses nationally consistent data sets
    and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help communities
    initiate resilience planning efforts. Currently the extent of this dataset is
    limited to the footprint of the pilot version of the Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper,
    which includes 32 coastal counties in Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and
    New York. The footprint of the tool will be expanded to cover U. S. coastal areas
    along the Gulf and Atlantic. This is a cached map service. Tiles have been cached
    down to Level ID 11 (1:18,055).'

    included a main camp on drifting sea ice in the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska along
    with two satellite camps forming a station triangle with a 100 km side length.
    A detailed description of the observational program and a running account of the
    results can be found in the AIDJEX Bulletin series published between 1970 and
    the end of the project in 1978. The Bulletin is accessible in hard copy in the
    Roger G. Barry Resource Office for Cryospheric Studies at NSIDC. The Polar Science
    Center at the University of Washington maintains an AIDJEX electronic library.
    It includes downloadable copies of the contents of all 40 AIDJEX Bulletins, AIDJEX
    Operations Manuals for the Pilot Study and the Main Experiment, and other resources.
    The film was produced by Hannes Zell and Dieter Wittich of Vienna, Austria under
    an arrangement with the AIDJEX Project Office at the University of Washington.
    The transfer of the original 16 mm film to electronic medium was performed by
    Victory Studios of Seattle, Washington, USA. The digital copy was donated to NSIDC

  description: "This dataset, termed \"GAGES II\", an acronym for Geospatial Attributes
    of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow, version II, provides geospatial data and classifications
    for 9,322 stream gages maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). It is
    an update to the original GAGES, which was published as a Data Paper on the journal
    Ecology's website (Falcone and others, 2010b) in 2010. The GAGES II dataset consists
    of gages which have had either 20+ complete years (not necessarily continuous)
    of discharge record since 1950, or are currently active, as of water year 2009,
    and whose watersheds lie within the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and
    Puerto Rico. Reference gages were identified based on indicators that they were
    the least-disturbed watersheds within the framework of broad regions, based on
    12 major ecoregions across the United States. Of the 9,322 total sites, 2,057
    are classified as reference, and 7,265 as non-reference. Of the 2,057 reference
    sites, 1,633 have (through 2009) 20+ years of record since 1950. Some sites have
    very long flow records: a number of gages have been in continuous service since
    1900 (at least), and have 110 years of complete record (1900-2009) to date. The
    geospatial data include several hundred watershed characteristics compiled from
    national data sources, including environmental features (e.g. climate â\x80\x93
    including historical precipitation, geology, soils, topography) and anthropogenic
    influences (e.g. land use, road density, presence of dams, canals, or power plants).
    The dataset also includes comments from local USGS Water Science Centers, based
    on Annual Data Reports, pertinent to hydrologic modifications and influences.
    The data posted also include watershed boundaries in GIS format. This overall
    dataset is different in nature to the USGS Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN;
    Slack and Landwehr 1992), whose data evaluation ended with water year 1988. The
    HCDN identifies stream gages which at some point in their history had periods
    which represented natural flow, and the years in which those natural flows occurred
    were identified (i.e. not all HCDN sites were in reference condition even in 1988,
    for example, 02353500). The HCDN remains a valuable indication of historic natural
    streamflow data. However, the goal of this dataset was to identify watersheds
    which currently have near-natural flow conditions, and the 2,057 reference sites
    identified here were derived independently of the HCDN. A subset, however, noted
    in the BasinID worksheet as â\x80\x9CHCDN-2009â\x80\x9D, has been identified as
    an updated list of 743 sites for potential hydro-climatic study. The HCDN-2009
    sites fulfill all of the following criteria: (a) have 20 years of complete and
    continuous flow record in the last 20 years (water years 1990-2009), and were
    thus also currently active as of 2009, (b) are identified as being in current
    reference condition according to the GAGES-II classification, (c) have less than
    5 percent imperviousness as measured from the NLCD 2006, and (d) were not eliminated
    by a review from participating state Water Science Center evaluators. The data
    posted here consist of the following items:- This point shapefile, with summary
    data for the 9,322 gages.- A zip file containing basin characteristics, variable
    definitions, and a more detailed report.- A zip file containing shapefiles of
    basin boundaries, organized by classification and aggregated ecoregion.- A zip
    file containing mainstem stream lines (Arc line coverages) for each gage."

  description: This data set represents the area of bedrock geology types in square
    meters compiled for every catchment of NHDPlus for the conterminous United States.
    The source data set is the "Geology of the Conterminous United States at 1:2,500,000
    Scale--A Digital Representation of the 1974 P.B. King and H.M. Beikman Map" (Schuben
    and others, 1994). The NHDPlus Version 1.1 is an integrated suite of application-ready
    geospatial datasets that incorporates many of the best features of the National
    Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus
    includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,00-scale NHD), improved networking,
    naming, and value-added attributes (VAAs). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived
    catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first
    widely used in New England, and thus referred to as "the New England Method."
    This technique involves "burning in" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available
    building "walls" using the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting
    modified digital elevation model (HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives
    that agree with the NHD and WBD. Over the past two years, an interdisciplinary
    team from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (USEPA), and contractors, found that this method produces the best quality
    NHD catchments using an automated process (USEPA, 2007). The NHDPlus dataset is
    organized by 18 Production Units that cover the conterminous United States. The
    NHDPlus version 1.1 data are grouped by the U.S. Geologic Survey's Major River
    Basins (MRBs, Crawford and others, 2006). MRB1, covering the New England and Mid-Atlantic
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 1 and 2. MRB2, covering the South
    Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 3
    and 6. MRB3, covering the Great Lakes, Ohio, Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 4, 5, 7 and 9. MRB4, covering
    the Missouri River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 10-lower and 10-upper.
    MRB5, covering the Lower Mississippi, Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River
    basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 8, 11 and 12. MRB6, covering the Rio
    Grande, Colorado and Great Basin River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units
    13, 14, 15 and 16. MRB7, covering the Pacific Northwest River basins, contains
    NHDPlus Production Unit 17. MRB8, covering California River basins, contains NHDPlus
    Production Unit 18.

  description: This EnviroAtlas dataset shows the percent of each 12-digit Hydrologic
    Unit (HUC) subwatershed in the contiguous U.S. with potentially restorable wetlands.
    Beginning two centuries ago, many wetlands were turned into farm fields or urban
    areas, yet wetlands play an important role in removing water pollution, regulating
    water storage and flows, and providing habitat for wildlife. Potentially restorable
    wetlands for this map are lands currently in agriculture that naturally accumulate
    water and historically had poor drainage and hydric soils. By restoring some of
    these wetlands, it is hoped that the benefits of wetlands would also be restored.
    This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping
    activities related to the EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas)
    allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application
    to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.
    The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas)
    or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each
    attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet

  description: This data set represents the area of Hydrologic Landscape Regions (HLR)
    compiled for every catchment of NHDPlus for the conterminous United States. The
    source data set is a 100-meter version of Hydrologic Landscape Regions of the
    United States (Wolock, 2003). HLR groups watersheds on the basis of similarities
    in land-surface form, geologic texture, and climate characteristics. The NHDPlus
    Version 1.1 is an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial datasets that
    incorporates many of the best features of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)
    and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus includes a stream network
    (based on the 1:100,00-scale NHD), improved networking, naming, and value-added
    attributes (VAAs). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage
    areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first widely used in New
    England, and thus referred to as "the New England Method." This technique involves
    "burning in" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available building "walls" using
    the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital
    elevation model (HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree
    with the NHD and WBD. Over the past two years, an interdisciplinary team from
    the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (USEPA), and contractors, found that this method produces the best quality NHD
    catchments using an automated process (USEPA, 2007). The NHDPlus dataset is organized
    by 18 Production Units that cover the conterminous United States. The NHDPlus
    version 1.1 data are grouped by the U.S. Geologic Survey's Major River Basins
    (MRBs, Crawford and others, 2006). MRB1, covering the New England and Mid-Atlantic
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 1 and 2. MRB2, covering the South
    Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 3
    and 6. MRB3, covering the Great Lakes, Ohio, Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 4, 5, 7 and 9. MRB4, covering
    the Missouri River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 10-lower and 10-upper.
    MRB5, covering the Lower Mississippi, Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River
    basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 8, 11 and 12. MRB6, covering the Rio
    Grande, Colorado and Great Basin River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units
    13, 14, 15 and 16. MRB7, covering the Pacific Northwest River basins, contains
    NHDPlus Production Unit 17. MRB8, covering California River basins, contains NHDPlus
    Production Unit 18.

    in economic activity throughout the coastal regions of the United States. In regard
    to the sources of data, establishments, employment, and wages are taken from the
    Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). The data series also is known
    as the ES-202 data. These data are based on the quarterly reports of nearly all
    employers in the United States. These reports are filed with each state''s employment
    or labor department, and each state then transmits the data to the Bureau of Labor
    Statistics (BLS), where the national databases are maintained. The data for the
    Coastal Economies have been taken from the national databases at BLS (except in
    the case of Massachusetts). Gross State Product (GSP) data are taken from the
    Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which develops the estimates of GSP from a
    number of sources. In regard to "employment", data are reported by employers,
    not employees, and does not contain any information about age. There is no difference
    between "employed" and "employment". The source is known as the payroll survey,
    a survey filed by employers every 3 months showing the number of people employed
    at each establishment in each of the preceding 3 months. Detailed information
    on the geographies the data are available for can be found here: http://coast.noaa.gov/htdata/SocioEconomic/CoastalEconomy/CoastalEconomy_DataDescription.pdf'

  _url1: http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer
  description: The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) service from The National
    Map (TNM) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information
    about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds,
    and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and
    rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages,
    and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification
    and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related
    measures, a "reach code" through which other information can be related to the
    NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water
    and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream
    directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata
    that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The
    NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale
    maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale
    maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the
    United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater,
    and referred to as local resolution NHD. The NHD from The National Map supports
    many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling,
    data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on the NHD, go to
    http://nhd.usgs.gov/index.html. The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a companion
    dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain
    and other landscape characteristics. The drainage areas are nested within each
    other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will
    be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each
    of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage
    areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest
    averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels
    of data respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds,
    and Subwatersheds. For additional information on the WBD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html.
    The National Map hydrography data is commonly combined with other data themes,
    such as boundaries, elevation, structures, and transportation, to produce general
    reference base maps. The National Map viewer allows free downloads of public domain
    NHD and WBD data in either Esri File or Personal Geodatabase, or Shapefile formats.

  description: These raster datasets represent historical stand age. The last four
    digits of the file name specifies the year represented by the raster. For example
    a file named Age_years_historical_1990.tif represents the year 1990. Cell values
    represent the age of vegetation in years since last fire, with zero (0) indicating
    burned area in that year. Files from years 1860-2006 use a variety of historical
    datasets for Boreal ALFRESCO model spin up and calibration to most closely match
    historical wildfire dynamics.

  description: 'USCRN "Processed" Data (labeled as "uscrn-processed"): are interpreted
    values and derived geophysical parameters with other quality indicators processed
    from raw data (both Datalogger files and/or Raw Data from GOES and NOAAPort) by
    the USCRN Team. Climate variable types include air temperature, precipitation,
    soil moisture, soil temperature, surface temperature, wetness, global solar radiation,
    relative humidity, and wind at 1.5 m above the ground. Many additional engineering
    variables are also available. These data have been decoded, quality-flagged, and
    processed into level 1 hourly data (the only applied quality control is rounding
    some values as they enter the database), and includes additional calculated values
    such as precipitation (5-minute and hourly), hourly maximum temperature, hourly
    minimum temperature, average temperature (5-minute and hourly), soil moisture
    (volumetric water content, 5-minute values at the 5 cm depth and and hourly values
    at all depths) for all dielectric values in range, layer average soil moisture
    (5 minute and hourly), and layer average soil temperature (5 minute and hourly).
    It is the general practice of USCRN to not calculate derived variables if the
    input data to these calculations are flagged. These data records are versioned
    based on the processing methods and algorithms used for the derivations (versions
    are noted within the data netCDF file), and data are updated when the higher quality
    raw data become available from stations'' datalogger storage (Datalogger Files).'

  description: The total annual freezing and thawing indices are defined as the cumulative
    number of degree-days when air temperatures are below and above zero degrees Celsius.
    The total annual freezing index has been widely used to predict permafrost distribution;
    estimate the maximum thickness of sea, lake, and river ice, and the maximum depth
    of ground-frost penetration; and classify snow types. The annual total thawing
    index has been used to predict permafrost distribution and to estimate the maximum
    depth of thaw in frozen ground. Both total freezing and thawing indices are important
    parameters for engineering design in cold regions. Data coverage is global. The
    data set contains the total annual freezing and thawing indices with a spatial
    resolution of 0.5 degrees latitude by 0.5 degrees longitude. Two data files are
    available, for the freeze and thaw indices respectively, in flat binary format.
    Each file is approximately 1 MB in size. The total annual freezing and thawing
    indexes were calculated based upon the monthly mean air temperature by Legates
    and Willmott (1990).

    Virgin Islands. The purpose of the mapping viewer is to provide coastal managers
    and scientists with a preliminary look at sea level rise (slr) and coastal flooding
    impacts. Being able to visualize potential impacts from sea level rise is a powerful
    teaching and planning tool, and the viewer brings this capability to coastal communities.
    The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses nationally consistent data sets
    and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help gauge
    trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The Sea Level Rise and
    Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer may be accessed at: http://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr/.
    Some of the features of this tool are: 1. Displays potential future sea levels
    2. Provides simulations of sea level rise at local landmarks 3. Communicates the
    spatial uncertainty of mapped sea levels 4. Models potential marsh migration due
    to sea level rise 5. Overlays social and economic data onto potential sea level
    rise 6. Examines how tidal flooding will become more frequent with sea level rise'

  description: This data set represents the estimated area of level 3 ecological landscape
    regions (ecoregions), as defined by Omernik (1987), compiled for every catchment
    of NHDPlus for the conterminous United States. The source data set is Level III
    Ecoregions of the Continental United States (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
    2003). The NHDPlus Version 1.1 is an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial
    datasets that incorporates many of the best features of the National Hydrography
    Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus includes a
    stream network (based on the 1:100,00-scale NHD), improved networking, naming,
    and value-added attributes (VAAs). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments
    (drainage areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first widely
    used in New England, and thus referred to as "the New England Method." This technique
    involves "burning in" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available building "walls"
    using the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital
    elevation model (HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree
    with the NHD and WBD. Over the past two years, an interdisciplinary team from
    the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (USEPA), and contractors, found that this method produces the best quality NHD
    catchments using an automated process (USEPA, 2007). The NHDPlus dataset is organized
    by 18 Production Units that cover the conterminous United States. The NHDPlus
    version 1.1 data are grouped by the U.S. Geologic Survey's Major River Basins
    (MRBs, Crawford and others, 2006). MRB1, covering the New England and Mid-Atlantic
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 1 and 2. MRB2, covering the South
    Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 3
    and 6. MRB3, covering the Great Lakes, Ohio, Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 4, 5, 7 and 9. MRB4, covering
    the Missouri River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 10-lower and 10-upper.
    MRB5, covering the Lower Mississippi, Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River
    basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 8, 11 and 12. MRB6, covering the Rio
    Grande, Colorado and Great Basin River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units
    13, 14, 15 and 16. MRB7, covering the Pacific Northwest River basins, contains
    NHDPlus Production Unit 17. MRB8, covering California River basins, contains NHDPlus
    Production Unit 18.

  description: This image shows national-scale patterns of naturally occurring arsenic
    in potable ground-water resources of the continental United States. The image
    was generated from the most recent arsenic measurement available for each of 31,350
    wells and springs across the United States. Over 20,000 of the water samples were
    collected by the U.S. Geological Survey between 1973 and 2001. The remainder of
    the samples were collected by State agencies and analyzed by comparable laboratory
    techniques. The data set shows a moving 75th percentile, which can also be described
    as the maximum arsenic concentration found in 75% of samples within a moving 50
    km radius (the median size of a U.S. county). In other words, for any given 50-km-radius
    region in the data, lower concentrations of arsenic were found in 75% of sampled
    wells, while higher concentrations of arsenic were found in 25% of sampled wells.
    This is a revised version of the August 2002 map layer, with a corrected shoreline
    for Greenland.

  description: This data set contains the monthly secondary forcing data "File B"
    for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The
    data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present.
    The temporal resolution is monthly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. The NLDAS-2
    monthly secondary forcing data were generated from the NLDAS-2 hourly secondary
    forcing data, as monthly accumulation for precipitation and convective precipitation
    and monthly average for other variables. Monthly period of each month is from
    00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z at end of the month. The one exception to
    this is the first month (Jan. 1979) that starts from 00Z 02 Jan 1979, except for
    the monthly accumulated precipitation and convective precipitation that both start
    from 12Z 01 Jan 1979. Brief description about the NLDAS-2 hourly secondary forcing
    data can be found from the GCMD DIF for GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORB0125_H_V002 at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORB0125_H_V002.
    Details about the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing datasets can be found in Xia
    et al. (2012). The NLDAS-2 monthly land surface forcing fields are grouped into
    two GRIB files, "File A" and "File B". "File B" is the secondary (optional) forcing
    file and contains ten fields. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table
    to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_FORB_monthly.002.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition

  description: This dataset combines the work of several different projects to create
    a seamless data set for the contiguous United States. Data from four regional
    Gap Analysis Projects and the LANDFIRE project were combined to make this dataset.
    In the northwestern United States (Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Washington and Wyoming)
    data in this map came from the Northwest Gap Analysis Project. In the southwestern
    United States (Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah) data used in this
    map came from the Southwest Gap Analysis Project. The data for Alabama, Florida,
    Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee, and
    Virginia came from the Southeast Gap Analysis Project and the California data
    was generated by the updated California Gap land cover project. The Hawaii Gap
    Analysis project provided the data for Hawaii. In areas of the county (central
    U.S., Northeast, Alaska) that have not yet been covered by a regional Gap Analysis
    Project, data from the Landfire project was used. Similarities in the methods
    used by these projects made possible the combining of the data they derived into
    one seamless coverage. They all used multi-season satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+)
    from 1999-2001 in conjunction with digital elevation model (DEM) derived datasets
    (e.g. elevation, landform) to model natural and semi-natural vegetation. Vegetation
    classes were drawn from NatureServe's Ecological System Classification (Comer
    et al. 2003) or classes developed by the Hawaii Gap project. Additionally, all
    of the projects included land use classes that were employed to describe areas
    where natural vegetation has been altered. In many areas of the country these
    classes were derived from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). For the majority
    of classes and, in most areas of the country, a decision tree classifier was used
    to discriminate ecological system types. In some areas of the country, more manual
    techniques were used to discriminate small patch systems and systems not distinguishable
    through topography. The data contains multiple levels of thematic detail. At the
    most detailed level natural vegetation is represented by NatureServe's Ecological
    System classification (or in Hawaii the Hawaii GAP classification). These most
    detailed classifications have been crosswalked to the five highest levels of the
    National Vegetation Classification (NVC), Class, Subclass, Formation, Division
    and Macrogroup. This crosswalk allows users to display and analyze the data at
    different levels of thematic resolution. Developed areas, or areas dominated by
    introduced species, timber harvest, or water are represented by other classes,
    collectively refered to as land use classes; these land use classes occur at each
    of the thematic levels. Raster data in both ArcGIS Grid and ERDAS Imagine format
    is available for download at http://gis1.usgs.gov/csas/gap/viewer/land_cover/Map.aspx
    Six layer files are included in the download packages to assist the user in displaying
    the data at each of the Thematic levels in ArcGIS. In adition to the raster datasets
    the data is available in Web Mapping Services (WMS) format for each of the six
    NVC classification levels (Class, Subclass, Formation, Division, Macrogroup, Ecological
    System) at the following links. http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_NVC_Class_Landuse/MapServer

  description: The Submarine Arctic Science Program, SCICEX, is a federal interagency
    collaboration among the operational Navy, research agencies, and the marine research
    community to use nuclear-powered submarines for scientific studies of the Arctic
    Ocean. Unlike surface ships, submarines have the unique ability to operate and
    take measurements regardless of sea ice cover, weather conditions, and time of
    year. This allows for a broad and comprehensive investigation of an entire ocean
    basin. The goal of the program is to acquire comprehensive data about Arctic sea
    ice, water properties (biological, chemical, and hydrographic), and water depth
    (bathymetry) to improve our understanding of the Arctic Ocean basin and its role
    in the Earth's climate system. SCICEX is important because it adds critical pieces
    to the overall information needed to analyze sea ice and ocean dynamics. Data
    collection began in 1993 and is on going.

  description: 'This dataset is a result of the California Ocean Uses Atlas Project:
    a collaboration between NOAA''s National Marine Protected Areas Center and Marine
    Conservation Biology Institute. The Project was designed to enhance ocean management
    through geospatial data on the full range of significant human uses of California''s
    ocean environment from the shoreline to the 200 nm EEZ boundary. Data was gathered
    from regional ocean experts and users through participatory GIS methods.The California
    Ocean Uses Atlas Project fills a critical information gap in ocean management
    by providing an unprecedented, comprehensive, consistent and spatially explicit
    picture of human uses for management agencies, policy makers and stakeholders
    interested in sound and equitable ocean governance. Using participatory GIS concepts
    and applications, the Atlas Project generated spatial data and map products illustrating
    patterns, intensity, and temporal changes in a wide range of human uses in three
    broad categories of use: (i) fishing, (ii) non-consumptive, and (iii) industrial
    activities. The resulting datasets depict patterns of ocean use on a broad scale
    appropriate for a variety of ocean planning and management needs.'

  description: Since the early 1990s the Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly
    (GHCN-M) dataset has been an internationally recognized source of data for the
    study of observed variability and change in land surface temperature. It provides
    monthly mean temperature data for 7280 stations from 226 countries and territories,
    ongoing monthly updates of more than 2000 stations to support monitoring of current
    and evolving climate conditions, and homogeneity adjustments to remove non-climatic
    influences that can bias the observed temperature record. The release of version
    3 monthly mean temperature data in 2011 introduced a number of improvements and
    changes from the previous release that included consolidating "duplicate" series,
    updating records from recent decades, and the use of new approaches to homogenization
    and quality assurance. The next version of GHCN-Monthly is expected to be released
    in 2015. Version 4 will contain more than 30,000 stations with monthly mean temperature
    data and improved quality control and bias correction processes.

  description: This map layer is a grid map of North America including the Caribbean
    and most of Mexico. The map layer is an excerpt from a global assessment of forest
    fragmentation (Riitters et al., 2000). Each pixel value represents an index of
    forest fragmentation for the surrounding 81 sq. km. The map layer was created
    by applying spatial algorithms to a 1 sq. km. resolution map of global land cover
    (Loveland and Belward 1997) known as NAIGBP1_2L, obtained from the USGS Center
    for EROS Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) as part of the Global Land Cover
    Characteristics database (GLCC)(Loveland et al. 1991, 1999). One of six categories
    of fragmentation was identified for each forested pixel in North America from
    the amount of forest and its occurrence as adjacent forest pixels within a 9x9
    pixel (81 sq. km.) window surrounding the pixel on the original land-cover map.
    The map layer describes one aspect of forest fragmentation at one scale. The forest
    fragmentation index is designed to distinguish among types of fragmentation (e.g.,
    edges on the interior versus the exterior of a forest patch) and it also reflects
    differences in the absolute amount of forest present. However, no distinction
    was drawn between "natural" and "human-caused" fragmentation. The data available
    through the National Atlas of the United States are in GeoTIFF format. This is
    a revised version of the May 2002 map layer, with a corrected shoreline for Greenland.
    This map layer was previously distributed as the Forest Fragmentation Index Map
    of North America.

  description: Various shipping zones delineate activities and regulations for marine
    vessel traffic. Traffic lanes define specific traffic flow, while traffic separation
    zones assist opposing streams of marine traffic. Precautionary areas represent
    areas where ships must navigate with caution, and shipping safety fairways designate
    where artificial structures are prohibited. Recommended Routes are predetermined
    routes for shipping adopted for reasons of safety. Along certain zones of the
    East Coast of the United States, ships are also required to report vessel location
    within designated endangered species areas, such as the North Atlantic right whale.
    Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas need special protection because of their vulnerability
    to damage by international maritime activities. Areas to be Avoided are within
    defined limits where navigation is particularly hazardous or it is exceptionally
    important to avoid casualties and should be avoided by all ships or certain classes
    of ships.

    Each climate division record includes a weekly averaged atmospheric temperature,
    precipitation, soil moisture in the upper and lower layers, percentage of flood
    capacity, potential evaporation, runoff, crop moisture and change from previous
    week, monthly moisture anomaly, preliminary or final Palmer Drought Severity Index
    (PDSI), and precipitation needed to end drought value. The CPC preliminary data
    are collected in near real-time from ground stations throughout the U.S., and
    are displayed in tabular form. The preliminary values are replaced by quality
    controlled data from the National Climatic Data Center with an approximate time
    lag of 3 to 6 months.

  description: 'This dataset consists of Level III weather radar products collected
    from Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) stations located in the contiguous United
    States, Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. territories and at military base sites. NEXRAD is
    a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National
    Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S.
    Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds, which
    allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events, such as rain, ice pellets,
    snow, hail, and tornadoes, as well as some non-weather objects like birds and
    insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D)
    system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency
    between 2,700 and 3,000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning
    Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no
    precipitation activity in the area, and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster
    scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns
    (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP
    is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles
    and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The
    radar scan times 4.5, 5, 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. During
    2008, the WSR-88D radars were upgraded to produce increased spatial resolution
    data, called Super Resolution. The earlier Legacy Resolution data provides radar
    reflectivity at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 1 km range gate resolution to a range
    of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 1.0 degree azimuthal by
    250 m range gate resolution to a range of 230 km. The upgraded Super Resolution
    data provides radar reflectivity at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution
    to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 0.5 degree azimuthal
    by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 300 km. Super resolution makes a
    compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution.
    In 2010, the deployment of the Dual Polarization (Dual Pol) capability to NEXRAD
    sites began with the first operational Dual Pol radar in May 2011. Dual Pol radar
    capability adds vertical polarization to the previous horizontal radar waves,
    in order to more accurately discern the return signal. This allows the radar to
    better distinguish between types of precipitation (e.g., rain, hail and snow),
    improves rainfall estimates, improves data retrieval in mountainous terrain, and
    aids in removal of non-weather artifacts. The NEXRAD products are divided in two
    data processing levels. The lower Level II data are base products at original
    resolution. Level II data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D
    sites. From the Level II quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological
    analysis Level III products. The Level III data consists of reduced resolution,
    low-bandwidth, base products as well as many derived, post-processed products.
    Level III products are recorded at most U.S. sites, though non-US sites do not
    have Level III products. There are over 40 Level III products available from the
    NCDC. General products for Level III include the base and composite reflectivity,
    storm relative velocity, vertical integrated liquid, echo tops and VAD wind profile.
    Precipitation products for Level III include estimated ground accumulated rainfall
    amounts for one and three hour periods, storm totals, and digital arrays. Estimates
    are based on reflectivity to rainfall rate (Z-R) relationships. Overlay products
    for Level III are alphanumeric data that give detailed information on certain
    parameters for an identified storm cell. These include storm structure, hail index,
    mesocyclone identification, tornadic vortex signature, and storm tracking information.
    Radar messages for Level III are sent by the radar site to users in order to know
    more about the radar status and special product data. NEXRAD data are provided
    to the NOAA National Climatic Data Center for archiving and dissemination to users.
    Data coverage varies by station and ranges from May 1992 to 1 day from present.
    Most stations began observing in the mid-1990s, and most period of records are
    continuous.'

  description: 'The NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) was initially completed
    for the 31-year period from 1979 to 2009, in January 2010. The CFSR was designed
    and executed as a global, high resolution, coupled atmosphere-ocean-land surface-sea
    ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains
    over this 31-year period. The CFSR has also been extended as an operational, real
    time product into the future. New features of the CFSR include: (1) coupling of
    atmosphere and ocean during the generation of the 6 hour guess field; (2) an interactive
    sea-ice model; and (3) assimilation of satellite radiances by the Grid-point Statistical
    Interpolation (GSI) scheme over the entire period. The CFSR global atmosphere
    resolution is approximately 38 km (T382) with 64 levels extending from the surface
    to 0.26 hPa. The global ocean''s latitudinal spacing is 0.25 deg at the equator,
    extending to a global 0.5 deg beyond the tropics, with 40 levels to a depth of
    4737m. The global land surface model has four4 soil levels and the global sea
    ice model has 3 layers. The CFSR atmospheric model has observed variations in
    carbon dioxide (CO2) over the 1979-2009 period, together with changes in aerosols
    and other trace gases and solar variations. Most available in-situ and satellite
    observation data were included in the CFSR. Satellite-based radiance observations
    were bias corrected with spin-up runs at full resolution, taking into account
    variable CO2 concentrations. This procedure enabled smooth transitions of the
    observation record due to evolutionary changes in satellite observing systems.
    The CFSR atmospheric, oceanic and land surface output products are available at
    an hourly time resolution and at a 0.5 deg x 0.5 deg latitude and longitude resolution.
    In total, there are 10 data products available from the National Climatic Data
    Center that make up the CFS Reanalysis collection: MON - Monthly Means; TIME -
    Parameter Timeseries; PGB - 3-D Pressure Level Data; FLX - Surface and Radiative
    Fluxes; OCN - 3-D Ocean Data; IPV - 3-D Isentropic Level Data; DIAB - 3-D Diabatic
    Heating Data; GRBLOW - Low-Resolution Data; HIC - High-Res Initial Conditions;
    LIC - Low-Res Initial Conditions. All data are in GRIB-2 format, except for the
    initial condition data which are in native binary formats. Total CFSR data volume
    is approximately 200 TB.'

  description: This data set represents the mean percent impervious surface from the
    Imperviousness Layer of the National Land Cover Dataset 2001 (LaMotte and Wieczorek,
    2010), compiled for every catchment of NHDPlus for the conterminous United States.
    The source data set represents imperviousness for the conterminous United States
    for 2001. The Imperviousness Layer of the National Land Cover Data Set for 2001
    was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land
    Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of Federal
    agencies (http://www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),
    the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency (USEPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S.
    Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
    Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the USDA Natural Resources
    Conservation Service (NRCS). The NHDPlus Version 1.1 is an integrated suite of
    application-ready geospatial datasets that incorporates many of the best features
    of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED).
    The NHDPlus includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,00-scale NHD), improved
    networking, naming, and value-added attributes (VAAs). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived
    catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first
    widely used in New England, and thus referred to as "the New England Method."
    This technique involves "burning in" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available
    building "walls" using the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting
    modified digital elevation model (HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives
    that agree with the NHD and WBD. Over the past two years, an interdisciplinary
    team from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (USEPA), and contractors, found that this method produces the best quality
    NHD catchments using an automated process (USEPA, 2007). The NHDPlus dataset is
    organized by 18 Production Units that cover the conterminous United States. The
    NHDPlus version 1.1 data are grouped by the U.S. Geologic Survey's Major River
    Basins (MRBs, Crawford and others, 2006). MRB1, covering the New England and Mid-Atlantic
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 1 and 2. MRB2, covering the South
    Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 3
    and 6. MRB3, covering the Great Lakes, Ohio, Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 4, 5, 7 and 9. MRB4, covering
    the Missouri River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 10-lower and 10-upper.
    MRB5, covering the Lower Mississippi, Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River
    basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 8, 11 and 12. MRB6, covering the Rio
    Grande, Colorado and Great Basin River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units
    13, 14, 15 and 16. MRB7, covering the Pacific Northwest River basins, contains
    NHDPlus Production Unit 17. MRB8, covering California River basins, contains NHDPlus
    Production Unit 18.

    2013</p> <p>These data sets were recently revised. Please refer to the Documentation
    link provided above for details regarding data corrections and reprocessing.</p><hr>
    NSIDC provides a suite of value-added data sets to aid in investigations of the
    variability and trends of sea ice cover. These data sets provide users with information
    about sea ice extent, total ice-covered area, ice persistence, monthly climatologies
    of sea ice concentrations, and ocean masks. The maps are in ArcInfo export file
    format. All other data sets are in flat binary or ASCII format with accompanying
    Portable Network Graphics (PNG) browse images. Products are derived from Nimbus-7
    SMMR; DMSP-F8, -F11, and -F13 SSM/I; and from DMSP-F17 SSMIS sea ice concentrations
    at a grid cell size of 25 x 25 km. Data begin in October 1978 and processing is
    ongoing. Data are available via FTP.

    title: USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) Overlay Map Service from The National
      Map - National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDA) Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)
  _identifier: 10214694-55cc-4dc6-aab5-1b9f2cab0d0b
  _url1: http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer
  description: The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) from The National Map (TNM) defines
    the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics.
    The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area,
    such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage
    areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can further be
    subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different
    levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The
    WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined
    by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds. For
    additional information on the WBD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html. The USGS
    National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) service is a companion dataset to the WBD.
    The NHD is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information
    about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds,
    and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and
    rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages,
    and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification
    and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related
    measures, a "reach code" through which other information can be related to the
    NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water
    and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream
    directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata
    that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The
    NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale
    maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale
    maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the
    United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater,
    and referred to as local resolution NHD. For more information on the NHD, go to
    http://nhd.usgs.gov/index.html. Hydrography data from The National Map supports
    many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling,
    data maintenance, and stewardship. Hydrography data is commonly combined with
    other data themes, such as boundaries, elevation, structures, and transportation,
    to produce general reference base maps. The National Map viewer allows free downloads
    of public domain WBD and NHD data in either Esri File or Personal Geodatabase,
    or Shapefile formats.

  description: Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data characterize the marine
    and coastal environments and wildlife based on sensitivity to spilled oil. Coastal
    species that are listed as threatened, endangered, or as a species of concern,
    by either federal or state governments, are a primary focus. A subset of the ESI
    data, the ESI Threatened and Endangered Species (T&E) databases focus strictly
    on these species. Species are mapped individually. In addition to showing spatial
    extent, each species polygon, point, or line has attributes describing abundance,
    seasonality, threatened/endangered status, and life history. Both the state and
    federal status is provided, along with the year the ESI data were published. This
    is important, as the status of a species can vary over time. As always, the ESI
    data are a snapshot in time. The biology layers focus on threatened/endangered
    status, areas of high concentration, and areas where sensitive life stages may
    occur. Supporting data tables provide species-/location-specific abundance, seasonality,
    status, life history, and source information. Human-use resources mapped include
    managed areas (parks, refuges, critical habitats, etc.) and resources that may
    be impacted by oiling and/or cleanup, such as beaches, archaeological sites, marinas,
    etc. ESIs are available for the majority of the US coastline, as well as the US
    territories. ESI data are available as PDF maps, as well as in a variety of GIS
    formats. For more information, go to http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/esi

    are based on satellite-derived maps of NH SCE produced weekly by trained NOAA
    meteorologists. In June 1999 weekly NOAA NH SCE maps ceased production, and were
    replaced by daily SCE output from the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping
    System (IMS). The weekly SCE maps are digitized to an 88x88 (cells) Cartesian
    grid laid over a NH polar stereographic projection. Each grid cell in the NH SCE
    CDR has a binary value, indicating snow covered or snow free. The NH SCE CDR has
    been used in international assessments of climate variability and change, and
    in investigations regarding the role of snow cover in the climate system. Mapping
    accuracy is such that this product is considered suitable for continental-scale
    climate studies. The data are updated monthly in netCDF file format with variables
    including SCE and National Meteorological Center (NMC) grid (88x88 cell) coordinates.

  description: Critical habitat (CH) is designated for the survival and recovery of
    species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
    Critical habitat includes those areas occupied by the species, on which are found
    physical and biological features that are essential to the conservation of an
    ESA listed species and which may require special management considerations or
    protection. Critical habitat may also include unoccupied habitat if the Secretary
    determines that the unoccupied habitat is essential for the conservation of the
    species. Critical habitat is designated by regulation at the time a species is
    listed under the ESA unless it is not prudent to do so or it is not determinable
    at the time. If it is not determinable, then NMFS must designate CH no later than
    one year after publication of a final listing. After identifying areas that meet
    the definition of CH, NMFS conducts an analysis to determine whether the economic,
    national security, or other relevant impacts of designating some areas as CH outweigh
    the benefits to the species. If so, NMFS may exclude such areas from the final
    CH designation. Each proposed and final regulation is published in the Federal
    Register. The final CH designation is also published in the Code of Federal Regulations
    (50 CFR 226).

    sets using output from two climate system models [CCCma (Canadian Centre for Climate

    were run. First, a set of selected biogeochemical models and coupled biogeochemical-biogeographical
    models were run from 1895 to 1993 to compare model responses to the historical
    time series and current ecosystem biogeochemistry. Second, these same models were
    run on the projected 1994 to 2100 data to compare their ecological responses to
    transient scenarios of climate and atmospheric CO2 change. Model runs were performed
    for daily, monthly, and annual gridded data sets. The output of the annual model
    runs in VEMAP grid format are contained in this data set. The models investigated
    included five biogeochemical cycling models, which simulate plant production and

  description: 'A Fiducial site is a geographic location that is used as a benchmark
    for the long-term monitoring of processes, both natural and anthropogenic, associated
    with the causes and effects of global environmental change. The word fiducial
    carries multiple meanings with regard to the GFL. Fiducials are marks or points
    of reference applied to images to present a fixed standard of reference, so in
    the GFL they refer to the identification of a place on the Earth. The term fiducial
    may also be interpreted to refer to a long-term trust, where one may be holding
    something in trust for another. Both references aptly apply, as the GFL maintains
    a long-term record of data over specific places on the Earth to be available for
    scientific investigations. Fiducial sites are associated with Earth processes
    and environmentally sensitive areas that are being monitored so that scientists
    can better understand and model the dynamic systems and changes that are occurring.
    The sites are located around the globe and are distributed among environmental
    topics and processes within five major disciplines: Ocean Processes; Ice and Snow
    Dynamics; Atmospheric Processes; Land Use/Land Cover; and Geologic Processes.'

  _identifier: C1028-NSIDCV0
  _poc_org: National Aeronautics and Space Administration
  description: The data set consists of monthly global snow cover and snow depth derived
    from Nimbus-7 SMMR data for 1978 through 1987. The SMMR data are interpolated
    for spatial and temporal gaps, and averaged for display in polar stereographic
    projection. Maps are based on six-day average brightness temperature data from
    the middle week of each month. Data are placed into 1/2 degree latitude by 1/2
    degree longitude grid cells uniformly subdividing a polar stereographic map according
    to the geographic coordinates of the center of the radiometers' fields of view.
    Overlapping data from separate orbits in the same six-day period are averaged
    to give a single brightness temperature assumed to be at the cell's center. Oceans
    and bays are masked so that only microwave data for land areas are displayed.
    Comparisons of SMMR snow cover maps with previous maps produced by NOAA/NESDIS
    and US Air Force Global Weather Center indicate that the total snow covered area
    derived from SMMR is usually about ten percent less than that measured by the
    earlier products, because passive microwave sensors often can't detect shallow
    dry snow less than about 5 cm deep. Snow depths are comparable, showing SMMR results
    to be especially good for uniform snow covered areas such as the Canadian high
    plains and Russian steppes. Heavily forested and mountainous areas tend to mask
    the microwave snow signatures, and SMMR snow depth derivations are less reliable
    in those areas. Formerly distributed by NASA/GSFC/NSSDC and NASA Pilot Land Data
    System (PLDS), these data are now available via ftp from NSIDC.

  description: This data set represents the average contact time, in units of days,
    compiled for every catchment of NHDPlus for the conterminous United States. Contact
    time, as described in Wolock and others (1989), is the baseflow residence time
    in the subsurface. The source data set was the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS)
    1-kilometer grid for the conterminous United States (D.M. Wolock, U.S. Geological
    Survey, written commun., 2008). The grid was created using a method described
    by Wolock and others (1997a; see equation 3). In the source data set, the contact
    time was estimated from 1-kilometer resolution elevation data (Verdin and Greenlee,
    1996 ) and STATSGO soil characteristics (Wolock, 1997b). The NHDPlus Version 1.1
    is an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial datasets that incorporates
    many of the best features of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National
    Elevation Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,00-scale
    NHD), improved networking, naming, and value-added attributes (VAAs). NHDPlus
    also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage
    enforcement technique first widely used in New England, and thus referred to as
    "the New England Method." This technique involves "burning in" the 1:100,000-scale
    NHD and when available building "walls" using the National Watershed Boundary
    Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital elevation model (HydroDEM) is used
    to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHD and WBD. Over the past
    two years, an interdisciplinary team from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and
    the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and contractors, found that
    this method produces the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process
    (USEPA, 2007). The NHDPlus dataset is organized by 18 Production Units that cover
    the conterminous United States. The NHDPlus version 1.1 data are grouped by the
    U.S. Geologic Survey's Major River Basins (MRBs, Crawford and others, 2006). MRB1,
    covering the New England and Mid-Atlantic River basins, contains NHDPlus Production
    Units 1 and 2. MRB2, covering the South Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins,
    contains NHDPlus Production Units 3 and 6. MRB3, covering the Great Lakes, Ohio,
    Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy River basins, contains NHDPlus Production
    Units 4, 5, 7 and 9. MRB4, covering the Missouri River basins, contains NHDPlus
    Production Units 10-lower and 10-upper. MRB5, covering the Lower Mississippi,
    Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units
    8, 11 and 12. MRB6, covering the Rio Grande, Colorado and Great Basin River basins,
    contains NHDPlus Production Units 13, 14, 15 and 16. MRB7, covering the Pacific
    Northwest River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Unit 17. MRB8, covering California
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Unit 18.

  description: 'Abstract: A CPC forecaster (from a rotating schedule of 5 as of August
    2013) creates the Seasonal Drought Outlook map and narratives. The map, produced
    using GIS, shows where current drought areas are expected to improve, be removed,
    or persist with intensity, as well as new areas where drought may develop, at
    the end of the forecast period. The current drought areas are obtained from the
    most recent weekly U.S. Drought Monitor where drought is considered D1 (moderate
    drought) or worse. There are two narratives: a brief, general summary and a detailed,
    regional technical discussion that describes the thought process, forecast tools
    used, and confidence for each region on the map. These outlook products apply
    to the following 3-month period from the date of issue. Originally produced once
    a month on the third Thursday of each month, the SDOs were changed to twice a
    month in June 2007 (initial SDO third Thursday of month, updated SDO first Thursday
    of next month). Since June 30, 2013, however, the SDO is now produced once a month
    on the third Thursday. The forecast applies to all 50 states of the United States
    plus Puerto Rico.'

    of meteorological parameters for thousands of U.S. stations located across the
    50 states, as well as U.S. territories, commonwealths, the Compact of Free Association
    nations, and one station in Canada. NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of
    data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate
    conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations
    as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program
    (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau
    Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate
    Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes
    various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum
    and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others),
    precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies
    and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including
    temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and
    cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product
    or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe
    station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data.
    All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken
    from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical
    Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP).
    These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation
    of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.

    for each Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) 12-Digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC-12)
    of the conterminous United States based on the National Land Cover Database (NLCD)
    from 2006, the December 30, 2009 Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database, and
    the USDA's Cropland Data Layer (CDL) data from 2010. The dataset includes the
    percentages of each HUC-12 belonging to several land cover groups that are on
    land with a Wetness Index greater than 550 (WET550). This dataset was produced
    by Tetra Tech, Inc. to support research and online mapping activities related
    to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas) allows the
    user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view and
    analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The dataset
    is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas)
    or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each
    attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet

  description: 'This shapefile represents annual average net power estimates. The
    OTEC Plant model predicts the net power production at a specific location, given
    three inputs: surface temperature (°C), depth (m), and difference between warm
    surface water temperature and cold deep sea water temperature (ΔT in °C) at the
    given depth, relative to the surface temperature. In order to normalize values
    for the purposes of visualization of the OTEC resource around the world, a baseline
    plant design was used. The baseline 100MW Net Power design has been optimized
    for conditions indicative of the Hawai‘i OTEC resource. As such, power output
    as described by the results of this study is not optimized for local conditions
    (except in parts of Hawai’i), but does provide guidance for site selection. Given
    the nominal plant power output of 100MW based on a competitive cost of electricity
    (Hawai’i), any output exceeding this value represents significant potential. A
    large area of predicted 100 MW+ net power exists in many locations around the
    world, especially in areas with high energy costs. Data were processed and converted
    to shapefile format by NREL for the [Ocean Thermal Extractable Energy Visualization](http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/1055457/1055457.pdf)

  description: This data set represents the area of surficial geology types in square
    meters compiled for every catchment of NHDPlus for the conterminous United States.
    The source data set is the "Digital data set describing surficial geology in the
    conterminous US" (Clawges and Price, 1999). The NHDPlus Version 1.1 is an integrated
    suite of application-ready geospatial datasets that incorporates many of the best
    features of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation
    Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,00-scale
    NHD), improved networking, naming, and value-added attributes (VAAs). NHDPlus
    also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage
    enforcement technique first widely used in New England, and thus referred to as
    "the New England Method." This technique involves "burning in" the 1:100,000-scale
    NHD and when available building "walls" using the National Watershed Boundary
    Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital elevation model (HydroDEM) is used
    to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHD and WBD. Over the past
    two years, an interdisciplinary team from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and
    the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and contractors, found that
    this method produces the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process
    (USEPA, 2007). The NHDPlus dataset is organized by 18 Production Units that cover
    the conterminous United States. The NHDPlus version 1.1 data are grouped by the
    U.S. Geologic Survey's Major River Basins (MRBs, Crawford and others, 2006). MRB1,
    covering the New England and Mid-Atlantic River basins, contains NHDPlus Production
    Units 1 and 2. MRB2, covering the South Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins,
    contains NHDPlus Production Units 3 and 6. MRB3, covering the Great Lakes, Ohio,
    Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy River basins, contains NHDPlus Production
    Units 4, 5, 7 and 9. MRB4, covering the Missouri River basins, contains NHDPlus
    Production Units 10-lower and 10-upper. MRB5, covering the Lower Mississippi,
    Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units
    8, 11 and 12. MRB6, covering the Rio Grande, Colorado and Great Basin River basins,
    contains NHDPlus Production Units 13, 14, 15 and 16. MRB7, covering the Pacific
    Northwest River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Unit 17. MRB8, covering California
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Unit 18.

  description: The Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) 2006-10 measures the social vulnerability
    of U.S. counties to environmental hazards. The index is a comparative metric that
    facilitates the examination of the differences in social vulnerability among counties.
    SoVI is a valuable tool for policy makers and practitioners. It graphically illustrates
    the geographic variation in social vulnerability. It shows where there is uneven
    capacity for preparedness and response and where resources might be used most
    effectively to reduce the pre-existing vulnerability. SoVI also is useful as an
    indicator in determining the differential recovery from disasters.The index synthesizes
    27 socioeconomic variables, which the research literature suggests contribute
    to reduction in a community's ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover
    from hazards. SoVI data sources include primarily those from the United States
    Census Bureau.The data are compiled and processed by the Hazards and Vulnerability
    Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. The data are standardized
    and placed into a principal components analysis to reduce the initial set of variables
    into a smaller set of statistically optimized components. Adjustments are made
    to the components' cardinality (positive (+) or negative (-)) to insure that positive
    component loadings are associated with increased vulnerability, and negative component
    loadings are associated with decreased vulnerability. Once the cardinalities of
    the components are determined, the components are added together to determine
    the numerical social vulnerability score for each county.SoVI 2006-10 marks a
    change in the formulation of the SoVI metric from earlier versions. New directions
    in the theory and practice of vulnerability science emphasize the constraints
    of family structure, language barriers, vehicle availability, medical disabilities,
    and healthcare access in the preparation for and response to disasters, thus necessitating
    the inclusion of such factors in SoVI. Extensive testing of earlier conceptualizations
    of SoVI, in addition to the introduction of the U.S. Census Bureau's five-year
    American Community Survey (ACS) estimates, warrants changes to the SoVI recipe,
    resulting in a more robust metric. These changes, pioneered with the ACS-based
    SoVI 2005-09 carry over to SoVI 2006-10, which combines the best data available
    from both the 2010 U.S. Decennial Census and five-year estimates from the 2006-2010
    ACS.

  description: The U.S. National Ice Center (NIC) is an inter-agency sea ice analysis
    and forecasting center comprised of the Department of Commerce/NOAA, the Department
    of Defense/U.S. Navy, and the Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Coast Guard
    components. Since 1972, NIC has produced Arctic and Antarctic sea ice charts.
    This data set is comprised of Arctic sea ice concentration climatology derived
    from the NIC weekly or biweekly operational ice-chart time series. The charts
    used in the climatology are from 1972 through 2007; and the monthly climatology
    products are median, maximum, minimum, first quartile, and third quartile concentrations,
    as well as frequency of occurrence of ice at any concentration for the entire
    period of record as well as for 10-year and 5-year periods. These climatologies
    and the charts from which they are derived are provided in the 25-km Equal-Area
    Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) binary (.bin) format. The climatologies are also
    available in ArcGIS geodatabases (.mdb), and GIF format browse files (.gif) are
    also provided.NIC charts are produced through the analyses of available in situ,
    remote sensing, and model data sources. They are generated primarily for mission
    planning and safety of navigation. NIC charts generally show more ice than do
    passive microwave derived sea ice concentrations, particularly in the summer when
    passive microwave algorithms tend to underestimate ice concentration. The record
    of sea ice concentration from the NIC series is believed to be more accurate than
    that from passive microwave sensors, especially from the mid-1990s on (see references
    at the end of this documentation), but it lacks the consistency of some passive
    microwave time series.

    solar radiation (including global, direct, and diffuse) and meteorological data
    for 1,454 stations. NCDC''s Integrated Surface Data (ISD) were the key data source
    for this effort, with much of the solar data modeled/estimated based on the surface
    observations. This dataset builds on the 1961-1990 NSRDB, which contains data
    for 239 stations. These data are extremely useful in estimating solar energy potential
    across the U.S., and in estimating heating/cooling requirements for buildings
    based on heat-gain from solar radiation. More information available at <a target="_blank"

  description: 'This Version 7 NOAA Fundamental Climate Data Record (CDR) from Remote
    Sensing Systems (RSS) contains brightness temperatures that have been inter-calibrated
    and homogenized over the observation time period. The temperature data are from
    the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager
    Sounder (SSMIS) series of passive microwave radiometers carried onboard the Defense
    Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites. These satellite sensors measure
    the natural microwave emission coming from the Earth’s surface in the spectral
    band from 19 to 85 GHz. This dataset encompasses data from a total of seven satellites
    including the SSM/I sensors on board DMSP satellites F08, F10, F11, F13, F14,
    and F15 as well as the SSMIS sensors on board DMSP satellite F17. The data record
    covers the time period from July 1987 through the present with a one month latency.
    The spatial and temporal resolutions of the CDR files correspond to the original
    resolution of the source SSMI(S) observations. There are roughly 15 orbits per
    day with a swath width of approximately 1400 km resulting in nearly global daily
    coverage. The spatial resolution of the data is a function of the sensor/channel
    and varies from approximately 50 km for the lowest frequency channels to approximately
    15km for the high-frequency channels. The output parameters include the observed
    brightness temperatures for each of the seven SSM/I channels and 24 SSMIS channels
    at the original sensor channel resolution along with latitude and longitude information,
    time, quality flags, and view angle information. The file format is netCDF-4 with
    added metadata that follow the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions and Attribute
    Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD). There are three major changes in the
    Version 7 processing: (1) the water vapor continuum absorption model was re-derived,
    (2) the clear-sky bias in cloud water was removed and the data format for cloud
    water was changed, and (3) the beamfilling correction in the rain algorithm was
    modified. Relative to Version 6, Version 7 has: (1) increased vapor values in
    the range of 50-60 mm by 1%, (2) increased vapor values above 60 mm by 2-3%, (3)
    cloud data changed to the range of cloud water values: -0.05 to 2.45 mm (cloud
    data format has changed), and (4) increased the global mean rain rates by about
    16% (mostly due to changes in the extratropical values).'

  description: 'We have completed an array of high-resolution simulations of present
    and future climate over Western North America (WNA) and Eastern North America
    (ENA) by dynamically downscaling global climate simulations using a regional climate
    model, RegCM3. The simulations are intended to provide long time series of internally
    consistent surface and atmospheric variables for use in climate-related research.
    In addition to providing high-resolution weather and climate data for the past,
    present, and future, we have developed an integrated data flow and methodology
    for processing, summarizing, viewing, and delivering the climate datasets to a
    wide range of potential users. Our simulations were run over 50- and 15-kilometer
    model grids in an attempt to capture more of the climatic detail associated with
    processes such as topographic forcing than can be captured by general circulation
    models (GCMs). The simulations were run using output from four GCMs. All simulations
    span the present (for example, 1968 to 1999), common periods of the future (2040
    to 2069), and two simulations continuously cover 2010 to 2099. The trace gas concentrations
    in our simulations were the same as those of the GCMs: the IPCC 20th century time
    series for 1968 to 1999 and the A2 time series for simulations of the future.
    We demonstrate that RegCM3 is capable of producing present day annual and seasonal
    climatologies of air temperature and precipitation that are in good agreement
    with observations. Important features of the high-resolution climatology of temperature,
    precipitation, snow water equivalent (SWE), and soil moisture are consistently
    reproduced in all model runs over WNA and ENA. The simulations provide a potential
    range of future climate change for selected decades and display common patterns
    of the direction and magnitude of changes. As expected, there are some model to
    model differences that limit interpretability and give rise to uncertainties.
    Here, we provide background information about the GCMs and the RegCM3, a basic
    evaluation of the model output and examples of simulated future climate. We also
    provide information needed to access the web applications for visualizing and
    downloading the data, and give complete metadata that describe the variables in
    the datasets.'

  description: NOAA is responsible for depicting on its nautical charts the limits
    of the 12 nautical mile Territorial Sea, 24 nautical mile Contiguous Zone, and
    200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The outer limit of each of these
    zones is measured from the U.S. normal baseline, which coincides with the low
    water line depicted on NOAA charts and includes closing lines across the entrances
    of legal bays and rivers, consistent with international law. The U.S. baseline
    and associated maritime limits are reviewed and approved through the interagency
    U.S. Baseline Committee, which is chaired by the U.S. Department of State. The
    Committee serves the function of gaining interagency consensus on the proper location
    of the baseline using the provisions of the 1958 Convention on the Territorial
    Sea and the Contiguous Zone, to ensure that the seaward extent of U.S. maritime
    zones do not exceed the breadth that is permitted by international law. In 2002
    and in response to mounting requests for digital maritime zones, NOAA launched
    a project to re-evaluate the U.S. baseline in partnership with other federal agencies
    via the U.S. Baseline Committee. The focus of the baseline evaluation was NOAA's
    largest scale, most recent edition nautical charts as well as supplemental source
    materials for verification of certain charted features. This dataset is a result
    of the 2002-present initiative and reflects a multi-year iterative project whereby
    the baseline and associated maritime limits were re-evaluated on a state or regional
    basis. In addition to the U.S. maritime limits, the U.S. maritime boundaries with
    opposite or adjacent countries as well as the US/Canada International Boundary
    (on land and through the Great Lakes) are also included in this dataset.

    integrates daily climate observations from approximately 30 different data sources.
    Version 3 was released in September 2012 with the addition of data from two additional
    station networks. Changes to the processing system associated with the version
    3 release also allowed for updates to occur 7 days a week rather than only on
    most weekdays. Version 3 contains station-based measurements from well over 90,000
    land-based stations worldwide, about two thirds of which are for precipitation
    measurement only. Other meteorological elements include, but are not limited to,
    daily maximum and minimum temperature, temperature at the time of observation,
    snowfall and snow depth. Over 25,000 stations are regularly updated with observations
    from within roughly the last month. The dataset is also routinely reconstructed
    (usually every week) from its roughly 30 data sources to ensure that GHCN-Daily
    is generally in sync with its growing list of constituent sources. During this
    process, quality assurance checks are applied to the full dataset. Where possible,
    GHCN-Daily station data are also updated daily from a variety of data streams.
    Station values for each daily update also undergo a suite of quality checks.

  description: The NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) was designed and
    executed as a global, high resolution, coupled atmosphere-ocean-land surface-sea
    ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains
    over the 31-year period of 1979 to 2009. A complete Reforecast of CFS version
    2, over the 30-year period (1981-2011) has been created in order to provide stable
    calibration and skill estimates of the new system, for operational seasonal and
    sub seasonal prediction at NCEP. Coupled full 9-month forecasts from initial conditions
    every 5 days apart (for all 4 cycles on that day) have been made for each calendar
    year with the T126L64 GFS with half-hourly coupling to the ocean (MOM4 at 0.25
    degree equatorial, 0.5 degree global). Total number of 9-month forecasts is 73x4
    for each year, amounting to 8468 forecast runs for the full period. In addition
    to the 9-month runs, there is a full season run from every 0Z cycle over a 12-year
    period (1999-2010) for a total of 4380 runs. There is also a short 45-day forecast
    from every 6Z, 12Z and 18Z cycle over the same 12-year period (1999-2010) for
    a total of 13140 runs.

    to 1910. The Major Land Uses (MLU) series is the longest running, most comprehensive
    accounting of all major uses of public and private land in the United States.
    The series was started in 1945, and has since been published about every 5 years,
    coinciding with the Census of Agriculture. See the latest report in the series,
    Major Uses of Land in the United States, 2007. Data from all 14 Major Land Uses
    reports have been combined into a set of files showing major land use estimates
    by region and State from 1945 to 2007. Alaska and Hawaii were added in 1959, when
    they achieved Statehood. Since Alaska contains such vast acreage, 50-State totals
    in all categories prior to 1959 may appear to change precipitously.

    total wet nitrogen deposition, total nitrogen deposition (wet+dry), total sulfur
    (SO2 + particulate SO4) dry deposition, total sulfur wet deposition, and total
    sulfur deposition. The dataset is based on output from the Community Multiscale
    Air Quality modeling system (CMAQ) run using the bidirectional flux option for
    the 12-km grid size for the US, Canada, and Mexico. The CMAQ output has been post-processed
    to adjust the wet deposition for errors in the location and amount of precipitation
    and for regional biases in the TNO3 (HNO3 + NO3), NHx (NH4 + NH3), and sulfate
    wet deposition. Model predicted values of dry deposition were not adjusted. This
    dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities
    related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas) allows
    the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view
    and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The
    dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas)

  description: This is a tiled collection of the National Elevation Dataset (NED)
    and is one meter resolution. Data in this layer represent a bare earth surface.
    The National Elevation Dataset (NED) serves as the elevation layer of The National
    Map, and provides basic elevation information for earth science studies and mapping
    applications in the United States. Scientists and resource managers use NED data
    for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping
    and visualization, and many other applications. The NED is an elevation dataset
    that consists of seamless layers and non-seamless high resolution layers. Each
    of the seamless layers are composed of the best available raster elevation data
    of the conterminous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, territorial islands, Mexico
    and Canada. The NED is updated continually as new data become available. All NED
    data are in the public domain. The NED is derived from diverse source data that
    are processed to a common coordinate system and unit of vertical measure. The
    spatial reference used for tiles of the one meter layer within the conterminous
    United States (CONUS) is Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) in units of meters,
    and in conformance with the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). All bare earth
    elevation values are in meters and are referenced to the North American Vertical
    Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). Each tile is distributed in the UTM Zone in which it lies.
    If a tile crosses two UTM Zones, it is delivered in both zones. Only source data
    of one meter resolution or finer are used to produce the NED standard one meter
    layer

  description: A gridded climatological monthly-mean data base of Arctic water vapor
    characteristics has been assembled by combining fixed station data with data from
    soundings taken over the Arctic Ocean from ships and Russian drifting stations.
    Variables provided include temperature, specific humidity, zonal vapor flux, meridional
    vapor flux, zonal wind speed, and meridional wind speed, available for 15 levels
    extending from the surface and then at every 50 mb from 950 mb to 300 mb; sea
    level pressure and geopotential height, available at 850 mb, 700 mb, 500 mb and
    300 mb; and precipitable water, vertically integrated zonal vapor flux and vertically
    integrated meridional vapor flux, available for five layers, surface to 850 mb,
    850 to 700 mb, 700 to 500 mb, 500 to 400 mb and 400 to 300 mb. Coverage of the
    rawinsonde archives extends from 1945 through 1990 for data from the Russian North
    Pole series of drifting ice stations over the Arctic Ocean; from 1976 through
    1991 for fixed-station data obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric
    Research; and from about 1958 through 1991 for fixed-station data obtained from
    the Historical Arctic Rawinsonde Archive. All variables were obtained through
    interpolation of the raw sounding data, with the exception of sea level pressure
    and geopotential height. The file, available via ftp, is structured in monthly
    data arrays over a subsection of the National Meteorological Center grid (octagonal
    grid format) centered over the pole, extending to approximately 65 degrees North
    on each side and about 55 degrees North at the corners.

  description: 'This raster data set represents water-level change in the High Plains
    aquifer of the United States from 1980 to 1995, in feet. The High Plains aquifer
    underlies 112.6 million acres (176,000 square miles) in parts of eight States:
    Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming.
    The aquifer''s saturated thickness ranges from near zero to about 1,200 feet (Weeks
    and Gutentag, 1981). Water-level declines occurred in parts of the High Plains
    aquifer soon after the onset of substantial irrigation with groundwater (about
    1950) (Luckey and others, 1981; Gutentag and others, 1984). This data set was
    generated in ESRI ArcInfo Workstation Version 9.3, which is a geographic information
    system (GIS), using water-level-change data from wells measured in 1980 and 1995
    and from some additional wells in New Mexico, which were measured in 1996 and
    1997. For this data set, areas of no substantial change were designated as areas
    where water-level change was between a rise of 3 feet and and decline of 3 feet;
    the raster was set to zero in the areas of no substantial change. REFERENCES CITED

  description: This layer of the National Elevation Dataset (NED) is 1/3 arc-second
    (approximately 10 m) resolution. The1/3 arc-second NED are derived from diverse
    source data that are processed to a common coordinate system and unit of vertical
    measure. These data are distributed in geographic coordinates in units of decimal
    degrees, and in conformance with the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). All
    elevation values are in meters and, over the continental United States, are referenced
    to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). The 1/3 arc-second NED
    layer provides seamless coverage of the conterminous United States, Hawaii, Puerto
    Rico, other territorial islands, and in limited areas of Alaska. The 1/3 arc-second
    NED layer is available as pre-staged products tiled in 1 degree blocks in Erdas
    .img, ESRI arc-grid, and grid float formats. The NED is updated continually as
    new data become available. All NED data are in the public domain.

  _url1: http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer
  description: USGS Hydro-NHD is a tile cache base map that combines hydrography data
    in The National Map from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) along with the
    Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The NHD is a comprehensive set of digital spatial
    data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies
    of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows
    (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features
    (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these
    features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic
    name, position and related measures, a "reach code" through which other information
    can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach
    codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement
    in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information,
    the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and
    improvements to the data. The NHD supports many applications, such as making maps,
    geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For
    additional information on NHD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/. The Watershed Boundary
    Dataset (WBD) is a companion dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage
    areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. Drainage areas
    are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper
    Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as
    the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can be further subdivided into
    smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this
    hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up
    of polygons nested into six levels of data, respectively defined by Regions, Subregions,
    Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds. For additional information on
    WBD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html.

  description: 'ABSTRACT: This database contains information compiled from published
    studies on gas flux from soil following rewetting or thawing. The resulting database
    includes 222 field and laboratory observations focused on rewetting of dry soils,
    and 116 field laboratory observations focused on thawing of frozen soils studies
    conducted from 1956 to 2010. Fluxes of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
    nitrogen oxide, and ammonia (CO2, CH4, N2O, NO and NH3) were compiled from the
    literature and the flux rates were normalized for ease of comparison. Field observations
    of gas flux following rewetting of dry soils include events caused by natural
    rainfall, simulated rainfall in natural ecosystems, and irrigation in agricultural
    lands. Similarly, thawing of frozen soils include field observations of natural
    thawing, simulated freezing-thawing events (i.e., thawing of simulated frozen
    soil by snow removal), and thawing of seasonal ice in temperate and high latitude
    regions (Kim et al., 2012). Reported parameters include experiment type, location,
    site type, vegetation, climate, soil properties, rainfall, soil moisture, soil
    gas flux after wetting and thawing, peak soil gas flux properties, and the corresponding
    study references. There is one comma-delimited data file.'

  description: This EnviroAtlas dataset includes industrial water demand attributes
    which provide insight into the amount of water currently used for manufacturing
    and production of commodities in the contiguous United States. The values are
    based on 2005 water demand and Dun and Bradstreet's 2009/2010 source data, and
    have been summarized by watershed or 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC). For
    the purposes of this metric, industrial water use includes chemical, food, paper,
    wood, and metal production. The industrial water is for self-supplied only such
    as by private wells or reservoirs. Sources include either surface water or groundwater.
    This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping
    activities related to the EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas)
    allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application
    to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.
    The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas)
    or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each
    attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet

  description: The Air Markets Program Data tool allows users to search EPA data to
    answer scientific, general, policy, and regulatory questions about industry emissions.
    Air Markets Program Data (AMPD) is a web-based application that allows users easy
    access to both current and historical data collected as part of EPA's emissions
    trading programs. This site allows you to create and view reports and to download
    emissions data for further analysis. AMPD provides a query tool so users can create
    custom queries of industry source emissions data, allowance data, compliance data,
    and facility attributes. In addition, AMPD provides interactive maps, charts,
    reports, and pre-packaged datasets. AMPD does not require any additional software,
    plug-ins, or security controls and can be accessed using a standard web browser.

  description: This EnviroAtlas web service supports research and online mapping activities
    related to EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas). This EnviroAtlas
    dataset shows potentially restorable wetlands at 30 meter resolution. Beginning
    two centuries ago, many wetlands were turned into farm fields or urban areas,
    yet wetlands play an important role in removing water pollution, regulating water
    storage and flows, and providing habitat for wildlife. Potentially restorable
    wetlands for this map are lands currently in agriculture that naturally accumulate
    water and historically had poor drainage and hydric soils. By restoring some of
    these wetlands, it is hoped that the benefits of wetlands would also be restored.
    This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping
    activities related to the EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas)
    allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application
    to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.
    The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas)
    or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each

  description: This EnviroAtlas dataset includes domestic water demand attributes
    which provide insight into the amount of water currently used for indoor and outdoor
    residential purposes in the contiguous United States. The values are based on
    2005 water demand and 2010 population distribution, and have been summarized by
    watershed or 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC). For the purposes of this metric,
    domestic water use includes residential uses, such as for drinking, bathing, cleaning,
    landscaping, and pools. Depending on the location, domestic water can be self-supplied,
    such as by private wells, or publicly-supplied, such as by municipalities. Sources
    include either surface water or groundwater. Estimates are for primary residences
    only (i.e., excluding second homes and tourism rentals). This dataset was produced

  description: This NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of Inter-Satellite Calibrated Clear-Sky
    High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) Channel 12 brightness temperatures
    contains over 30 years (1978-2013) of data. Among the twenty channels in the HIRS
    instrument, channel 12 measures upper tropospheric water vapor (UTWV). Multiple
    polar orbiting satellites in the NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental
    Satellite (POES) series and MetOp-A have carried HIRS instruments. Due to the
    independence in calibration of the individual HIRS instruments, biases exist between
    satellites. Examination of the intersatellite biases shows that the biases are
    scene brightness temperature dependent. These HIRS channel 12 measurements from
    the NOAA POES and MetOp-A are calibrated to a baseline satellite based on intersatellite
    bias correction data. The differences from the last version include that the dataset
    is now provided as monthly mean 2.5x2.5 degree latitude/longitude in netcdf format
    and the time series has been extended to the end of 2013. This CDR is key to understanding
    water vapor feedback climatology.

    State-level information used to create the State Snapshots is based on data collected
    for the National Healthcare Quality Report (NHQR). The State Snapshots include
    summary measures of quality of care and States' performances relative to all States,
    the region, and best performing States by overall health care quality, types of
    care (preventive, acute, and chronic), settings of care (hospitals, ambulatory
    care, nursing home, and home health), and clinical conditions (cancer, diabetes,
    heart disease, maternal and child health, and respiratory diseases). Special focus
    areas on diabetes, asthma, Healthy People 2010, clinical preventive services,
    disparities, payer, and variation over time are also featured. The Agency for

  description: SERVIR is a Spanish acronym for 'Regional Visualization and Monitoring
    System.' The&#160;SERVIR project enables the use of Earth observations and predictive
    models for timely decision making through regional platforms in Mesoamerica, East
    Africa, and the Hindu-Kush Himalayas. &#160;The SERVIR project was initially developed
    by NASA, the US Agency for International Development, the World Bank, the Central
    American Commission for Environment and Development (CCAD), and the Water Center
    for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC) in 2005. &#160;
    In 2008, the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD)
    in Nairobi, Kenya, joined the SERVIR project, and in 2010, SERVIR inaugurated
    its third hub at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development
    (ICIMOD) in Kathmandu, Nepal. &#160; SERVIR also stands for the Spanish verb 'to
    serve,' which is what the project aims to do in terms of providing improved access
    to data and knowledge for decision-making.

  description: The purpose of the Fisheries One-Stop-Shop (FOSS) is to make fisheries
    dependent information readily available to fisheries managers, scientists and
    the American public at a national as well as regional level. Collection and management
    of fisheries dependent data are distributed throughout NOAA Fisheries, State Fisheries,
    management agencies and regional Fisheries Information Networks (FINs). The distributed
    nature of NOAA Fisheries information systems, differences in collection authorities
    and confidentiality requirements increases the importance of this flexible technical
    architecture that can meet the changing needs for information at national, regional
    and local levels of resolution. At the same time, the technical architecture is
    scalable to meet enterprise wide requirements for management of other types of
    fisheries data and fisheries independent data. Currently available via FOSS are
    the summarized, non-confidential, annual Commercial Landings by state as provided
    through the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP), the Gulf
    of Mexico Fisheries Information Network (GulfFIN). Recreational Landings estimates
    are available and provided via NMFS Headquarters. In FY2011, FOSS will be expanded
    to include all commercial landings nationally.

    the ground, the air, and from space. These photographs constitute an important
    historical record, as well as a data collection of interest to those studying
    the response of glaciers to climate change. NSIDC partnered with the NOAA Climate
    Database Modernization Program (CDMP) and the National Geophysical Data Center
    (NGDC) to digitize selected photographs and make them available through a searchable
    interface.Most of the photographs are of glaciers in the Rocky Mountains, the
    Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and Greenland. However, the collection does include
    a smaller number of photos of glaciers in Europe, South America, the Himalayas,
    and Antarctica. The photos are available online via a searchable interface and
    are retrievable by glacier name, photographer name, date, country, state, and
    geographic coordinates.

  description: 'NOTICE: A significant issue with the precipitation variables in this
    dataset was found in January 2015. The precipitation data has two fewer columns
    than the temperature data, one from each edge. When merged into the same coordinate
    system, this caused the temperature data to be offset to the west by one pixel.
    The dataset is now broken into two sub-datasets, one for precipitation and one
    for temperature. This corrects the pixel location. Any use of precipitation data
    from this dataset from September 2013, when new precipitation files containing
    the issue were introduced, should be considered slightly in error. For more information
    please contact gdp@usgs.gov. In this project, we used an advanced statistical
    downscaling method that combines high-resolution observations with outputs from
    16 different global climate models based on 4 future emission scenarios to generate
    the most comprehensive dataset of daily temperature and precipitation projections
    available for climate change impacts in the U.S. The gridded dataset covers the
    continental United States, southern Canada and northern Mexico at one-eighth degree
    resolution and Alaska at one-half degree resolution. The high-resolution projections
    produced by this work have been rigorously quality-controlled for both errors
    and biases in the global climate and statistical downscaling models. We also calculated
    projected future changes in a broad range of impact-relevant indicators, from
    seasonal temperature to extreme precipitation days. The results of the error and
    bias tests and the indicator calculations are made available as part of this database.
    Additional information and raw data from this dataset can be found here: http://cida.usgs.gov/thredds/catalog.html
    Before using this dataset, please review the material summarized here: https://my.usgs.gov/confluence/display/GeoDataPortal/2014/04/16/Notice%3A+Evaluation+of+Maurer+gridded+observational+datasets+and+their+impacts+on+downscaled+products
    Note that the CONUS temperature and precipitation data were split into two sub
    datasets in January 2015. This was done because the precipitation data uses a
    slightly different longitude axis than the temperature data.'

    global coverage from January 1979 to the present and continuing monthly. Grid
    dimensions are 144 x 72, with 10,368 total grids over the globe. The data set
    was derived using a multispectral HIRS OLR algorithm on the HIRS level 1b dataset
    from the TIROS-N to NOAA-19 series satellites with inter-satellite and radiance
    calibration adjustments employing an empirical diurnal model for the monthly mean
    derivation. The data file format is netCDF-4 with CF metadata, and it is accompanied
    by algorithm documentation, data flow diagram and source code for the NOAA CDR
    Program.

  description: The U.S. Hourly Climate Normals for 1981 to 2010 are 30-year averages
    of meteorological parameters for thousands of U.S. stations located across the
    50 states, as well as U.S. territories, commonwealths, the Compact of Free Association
    nations, and one station in Canada. NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of
    data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate
    conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations
    as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program
    (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau
    Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate
    Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes
    various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum
    and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others),
    precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies
    and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including
    temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and
    cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product
    or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe
    station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data.
    All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken
    from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical
    Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP).
    These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation
    of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.

  description: 'This raster data set represents water-level change in the High Plains
    aquifer of the United States from 2005 to 2009, in feet. The High Plains aquifer
    underlies 112.6 million acres (176,000 square miles) in parts of eight States:
    Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming.
    The aquifer''s saturated thickness ranges from near zero to about 1,200 feet (Weeks
    and Gutentag, 1981). Water-level declines occurred in parts of the High Plains
    aquifer soon after the onset of substantial increases in irrigation with groundwater
    (about 1950) (Luckey and others, 1981; Gutentag and others, 1984). This data set
    was generated in ESRI ArcInfo Workstation Version 9.3, which is a geographic information
    system (GIS), using water-level-change data from wells measured in 2005 and 2009
    and from some additional wells in New Mexico, which were measured in 2006, 2007,
    and 2008. For this data set, areas of no substantial change were designated as
    areas where water-level change was between a rise of 1 foot and a decline of 1
    foot; the raster was set to zero in the areas of no substantial change. REFERENCES

    collection of data on race and ethnicity, to the four race categories specified

    American Indian or Alaska Native, White). Many data systems, such as vital statistics,
    are continuing to use the 1977 OMB standards during the transition to full implementation
    of the 1997 OMB standards. Postcensal estimates are available for year 2000 -
    2009; intercensal estimates are available for the years 1990-1999. Obtain population
    counts by Year, State, County, Race (4-categories), Ethnicity, Sex and Age (1-year
    or 5-year groups). The data are released by the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>

  description: 'The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) modeled the distribution of terrestrial
    ecosystems for the contiguous United States using a standardized, deductive approach
    to associate unique physical environments with ecological systems characterized
    in NatureServe''s Ecological Systems of the United States classification (Comer
    et al., 2003). This approach was first developed for South America (Sayre et al.,
    2008) and is now being implemented globally (Sayre et al., 2007). Unique physical
    environments were delineated from a massive biophysical stratification of the
    nation into the major structural components of ecosystems: biogeographic regions
    (Cress et al., 2008c), land surface forms (Cress et al., 2008a), surficial lithology
    (Cress et al., 2008d), and topographic moisture potential (Cress et al., 2008b).
    Each of these structural components was mapped for the contiguous United States
    and then spatially combined to produce ecosystem structural footprints which represented
    unique abiotic (physical) environments. Among 49,168 unique structural footprint
    classes, 13,482 classes which met a minimum pixel count threshold (20,000 pixels)
    were aggregated into 419 NatureServe ecosystems through semi-automated labeling
    process using rule set formulations for attribution of each ecosystem.'

  description: Yearly snow melt onset dates over Arctic sea ice are derived from Scanning
    Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I)
    brightness temperatures. The introduction of liquid water to snow results in a
    sharp increase in the emissivity and hence brightness temperature of the snowpack.
    Snow melt onset is defined as the point in time when microwave brightness temperatures
    increase sharply due to the presence of liquid water in the snowpack. Data cover
    the years 1979 through 2007, and are in a polar stereographic grid at 25 km resolution.
    Tab-delimited ASCII files and GIF images are accessible via FTP. Several value-added
    products are also available.

    railroads, trails, airports, and other features associated with the transport
    of people or commerce. The data include the name or route designator, classification,
    and location. Transportation data support general mapping and geographic information
    system technology analysis for applications such as traffic safety, congestion
    mitigation, disaster planning, and emergency response. The National Map transportation
    data is commonly combined with other data themes, such as boundaries, elevation,
    hydrography, and structures, to produce general reference base maps. The National
    Map viewer allows free downloads of public domain transportation data in either
    Esri File Geodatabase or Shapefile formats. For additional information on the

  description: <p>The Daily Fine Particulate Matter data available on CDC WONDER are
    geographically aggregated daily measures of fine particulate matter in the outdoor
    air, spanning the years 2003-2008. PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an
    aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily
    measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (''Âµg/m''Â³),
    the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation.
    Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus the District of
    Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified
    fine particulate matter (''Âµg/m''Â³)value. County-level and higher data are aggregated
    from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA
    Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall
    Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional
    surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous
    spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008.
    Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm,
    US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ
    data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution
    Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data.
    They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic
    locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties
    and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels
    in CDC WONDER.</p>

  description: "CoastWatch is a nationwide National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA) program within which the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory
    (GLERL) functions as the Great Lakes regional node. In this capacity, GLERL obtains,
    develops, and delivers environmental data and products for near real-time observation
    of the Great Lakes to support environmental science, decision making, and supporting
    research since 1990. This is achieved by providing Internet access to near real-time
    and retrospective satellite observations, derived products, modeled, and in-situ
    Great Lakes data. The goals and objectives of the CoastWatch Great Lakes Program
    directly support NOAA's statutory responsibilities in estuarine and marine science
    living marine resource protection, and ecosystem monitoring and management. The
    CoastWatch node at the NOAA/Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL)
    is receiving a product suite of enhanced digital images including satellite-derived
    surface water temperature (SST), visible and near-infrared reflectance, brightness
    temperatures, cloud masks, satellite/solar zenith angle data and graphics from
    the NOAA/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer), MetOp A and B, and
    NPP VIIRS (National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi) Visible Infrared Imaging
    Radiometer Suite) series of satellites in HDF format. These near real-time CoastWatch
    data are acquired by GLERL from NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data,
    and Information Service (NESDIS) on a daily schedule via Internet. The daytime
    and nighttime raster images are 1024 x 1024 in size having a nominal resolution
    of 1.3 km. The VIIRS \x93high resolution\x94 data has a nominal resolution of
    0.8 km and raster size of 1631 x 1631). The near real-time satellite data and
    derived products (as well as the 512 x 512, 2.6 km resolution data received prior
    to 2004 in CWF format) are available from the CoastWatch Great Lakes website (http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov).
    The data is also available from the NOAA CoastWatch Comprehensive Large Array-data
    Stewardship System (CLASS), an electronic library of NOAA environmental data.
    The AVHRR/MetOp SST data are cloud-masked and land-masked and used to create the
    GLSEA (Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis), a daily, cloud-free composite
    SST image with NIC ice concentration overlay during winter months (.png, .ascii,
    KML formats), cloud-masked and land-masked SST images in Geotif format, and 512
    x 512 subsets by lake in .png format. In addition, GOES (Geostationary Operational
    Environmental Satellites) visible, near infrared, water vapor, and SST images
    of the Great Lakes are received from NESDIS and MODIS true color 250m resolution
    imagery of each Great Lake (and synoptic scene) (received near real-time from
    the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin), in-situ
    and modeled data, including marine and meteorological observations, buoy observations,
    water level gauge measurements from NOAA's National Ocean Service, are routinely
    acquired or produced, stored, and made available to Great Lakes CoastWatch data
    users. Great Lakes Forecasting system (nowcast and forecast) products are also
    available to CoastWatch data users via the Great Lakes CoastWatch website (http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov)."

  description: The Unified Sea Ice Thickness Climate Data Record is the result of
    a concerted effort to collect as many observations as possible of Arctic sea-ice
    draft, freeboard, and thickness and to format them consistently with clear documentation,
    allowing the scientific community to better utilize what is now a considerable
    body of observations. The Unified Sea Ice Thickness Climate Data Record includes
    data from moored and submarine-based upward looking sonar (ULS) instruments, airborne
    electromagnetic (EM) induction instruments, satellite laser altimeters (ICESat),
    and airborne laser altimeters (IceBridge). These instruments offer adequate sampling,
    starting in 1975, to establish the mean Arctic sea-ice thickness and the sea-ice
    thickness distribution at scales generally appropriate for change detection and
    climate model validation. The Unified Sea Ice Thickness Climate Data Record consists
    of 15 different data sets. Each data set consists of a Summary file and a Distribution
    file. The Unified Sea Ice Thickness Climate Data Record does not currently contain
    Antarctic sea-ice data but is open to accepting such data.

  description: This data set provides sea ice extent for the Arctic (60-90 degrees
    North) and Antarctic (52-90 degrees South) in Scatterometer Image Reconstruction
    (SIR) binary image format, along with ASCII text files containing latitude and
    longitude coordinates along the sea ice edge, and browse images of SIR files in
    Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format. Ancillary products include daily-averaged
    total sea ice extent in ASCII format. Estimates of sea ice extent were produced
    from daily-averaged QuikSCAT sigma-0 measurements and extend from 19 July 1999
    to 31 December 2004. QuikSCAT obtains 12 individual radar normalized backscatter
    (sigma-0) measurements, called slices, for each footprint as it scans over a 1800
    km wide swath. Slices are typically 4 to 6 km long by 20 km wide. The summed measurements
    of the slices are called egg measurements. The effective resolution and shape
    of each egg measurement is approximately 20 by 30 km, depending on the antenna
    beam and instrument mode. This data set contains both slice and egg images for
    each day. The Microwave Earth Remote Sensing (MERS) group at Brigham Young University
    (BYU) developed a SIR-with-filtering (SIRF) algorithm that combines forward- and
    aft-looking sigma-0 measurements to produce enhanced-resolution backscatter images
    over various azimuth angles. The polarization ratio, incidence angle dependence,
    and the sigma-0 estimate error standard deviation were used to discriminate between
    sea ice and ocean. Sea ice extent was estimated for both slice and egg images.
    The nominal pixel resolution of the slice images is 2.225 km with an estimated
    effective resolution of approximately 4 km. Egg images have a nominal pixel resolution
    of 4.45 km with an estimated effective resolution of approximately 8 to 10 km.

  description: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for food is a component of the all-items
    CPI. The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban
    consumers for a representative market basket of consumer goods and services. While
    the all-items CPI measures the price changes for all consumer goods and services,
    including food, the CPI for food measures the changes in the retail prices of
    food items only.

  description: In this project, we used an advanced statistical downscaling method
    that combines high-resolution observations with outputs from 16 different global
    climate models based on 4 future emission scenarios to generate the most comprehensive
    dataset of daily temperature and precipitation projections available for climate
    change impacts in the U.S. The gridded dataset covers the continental United States,
    southern Canada and northern Mexico at one-eighth degree resolution and Alaska
    at one-half degree resolution. The high-resolution projections produced by this
    work have been rigorously quality-controlled for both errors and biases in the
    global climate and statistical downscaling models. We also calculated projected
    future changes in a broad range of impact-relevant indicators, from seasonal temperature
    to extreme precipitation days. The results of the error and bias tests and the
    indicator calculations are made available as part of this database.

  description: 'Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (hereafter, GLDAS-2)
    has two components: one forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing
    data (hereafter, GLDAS-2.0), and the other forced with a combination of model
    and observation based forcing data sets (hereafter, GLDAS-2.1). This data set,
    GLDAS-2.0 1.0 degree monthly generated through temporal averaging of the 3-hourly
    data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model
    3.3, currently covers from 1948 to 2010 and will be extended to recent years as
    the data set becomes available. The model simulation was initialized on simulation
    date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM
    climatology for that day of the year. The simulation was forced by the global
    meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006).
    The simulation used the common GLDAS data sets for land cover (MCD12Q1: Friedl
    et al., 2010), land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009), soil texture (Reynolds,
    1999), and elevation (GTOPO30). The MODIS based land surface parameters are used
    in the current GLDAS-2.x products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in
    GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012). The main objective
    for Version 2 is to create more climatologically consistent data sets using the
    Princeton forcing data sets extending from 1948. In Version 1, forcing sources
    switched several times throughout the record from 1979 to present, which introduced
    unnatural trends and exhibited highly uncertain forcing fields in 1995-1997. Other
    enhancements made in Version 2 include model version upgrade, switching to MODIS
    based land surface parameter data sets, and initialization of soil moisture over
    desert. In NOAH model, the bottom layer temperature data set was also updated.
    More details regarding the land surface parameter data changes at http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas/.
    WGRIB or other GRIB reader is required to read the files. The data set applies
    a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter numbers.
    The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_GLDAS_V2.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition
    Section (PDS) IDs and units. There are four vertical levels for the Soil Moisture
    (PDS 086) and Soil Temperature (PDS 085) in the Noah GRIB files. For more information,

    NSIDC is in the process of removing the bad data, and will be monitoring the incoming

    changes in sea ice. It is a source for consistent, up-to-date sea ice extent and
    concentration images and data values from November 1978 to the present.Sea Ice
    Index images depict ice cover and trends in ice cover in the Arctic and Antarctic
    oceans. Sea Ice Index data files tabulate ice extent in numbers. The images and
    data are produced in a consistent way that makes the Index time-series appropriate
    for use when looking at long-term trends in sea ice cover. Both monthly and daily
    products are available. However, monthly products are better to use for long-term
    trend analysis because errors in the daily product tend to be averaged out in
    the monthly product and because day-to-day variations are often the result of
    short-term weather.Monthly images show sea ice extent with an outline of the median
    extent for that month for comparison. Other monthly images show sea ice concentration
    as well as trends in concentration for that month. Monthly extent products are
    also available as geographic information systems (GIS) compatible shapefiles.
    Plain ASCII text data files contain monthly mean extent and area, in millions
    of square kilometers, by year. These monthly extent numbers are used for graphs
    of extent anomalies with trend lines and significance intervals. Anomalies and
    median extent are calculated using a 30-year reference period of 1981 through
    2010.Daily images show sea ice extent, with an outline of the median extent for
    that day for comparison, and sea ice concentration. Plain ASCII text data files
    contain daily extent, in millions of square kilometers, for almost every day from
    1978 onward. These daily extent numbers are used for graphs of daily extent over
    the last four months.'

  description: PARCA began in 1993 with the primary goal of measuring and understanding
    the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Approximately 25 investigations used
    in situ measurements and satellite and aircraft remote sensing to study this issue.
    Measurements include surface elevation and ice thickness change rates from aircraft
    laser altimetry, shallow to intermediate ice cores (for average accumulation rates
    and their temporal and spatial variability), velocity around the ice-sheet perimeter
    at an elevation of about 2000 meters, local ice thickening/thinning rates, and
    climatological observations from automatic weather stations. Satellite data used
    include elevation change from radar altimetry; mapping of snow facies and zones
    of summer melt from passive and active microwave; ice velocities from interferometric
    synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and from repeat high-resolution visible and SAR
    imagery; mapping surface and 10-m temperatures, accumulation rates, and surface
    albedo from microwave and AVHRR data. Data are available either by FTP or through
    investigator Web sites. Questions about investigator data should be directed to
    the individual technical contacts responsible for each data set. The National
    Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) provides summaries and links to these data as

  _identifier: C195219449-GSFCS4PA
  _poc_org: National Aeronautics and Space Administration
  description: 'This data set contains the primary forcing data &quot;File A&quot;
    for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The
    data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present.
    The temporal resolution is hourly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. Details about
    the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing datasets can be found in Xia et al. (2012).
    The non-precipitation land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are derived from
    the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). NARR
    analysis fields are 32-km spatial resolution and 3-hourly temporal frequency.
    Those NARR fields that are utilized to generate NLDAS-2 forcing fields are spatially
    interpolated to the finer resolution of the NLDAS 1/8th-degree grid and then temporally
    disaggregated to the NLDAS hourly frequency. Additionally, the fields of surface
    pressure, surface downward longwave radiation, near-surface air temperature, and
    near-surface specific humidity are adjusted vertically to account for the vertical
    difference between the NARR and NLDAS fields of terrain height. This vertical
    adjustment applies the traditional vertical lapse rate of 6.5 K/km for air temperature.
    The details of the spatial interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical
    adjustment are those employed in NLDAS-1, as presented by Cosgrove et al. (2003).
    The surface downward shortwave radiation field in &quot;File A&quot; is a bias-corrected
    field wherein a bias-correction algorithm was applied to the NARR surface downward
    shortwave radiation. This bias correction utilizes five years (1996-2000) of the
    hourly 1/8th-degree GOES-based surface downward shortwave radiation fields derived
    by Pinker et al. (2003). The potential evaporation field in &quot;File A&quot;
    is that computed in NARR using the modified Penman scheme of Mahrt and Ek (1984).
    The precipitation field in &quot;File A&quot; is not the NARR precipitation forcing,
    but is rather a product of a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis
    of daily precipitation, performed directly on the NLDAS grid and including an
    orographic adjustment based on the widely-applied PRISM climatology. The precipitation
    is temporally disaggregated into hourly fields by deriving hourly disaggregation
    weights from either WSR-88D Doppler radar-based precipitation estimates, 8-km
    CMORPH hourly precipitation analyses, or NARR-simulated precipitation (based on
    availability, in order). The latter fields from radar, CMORPH, and NARR are used
    only to derive disaggregation weights and do not change the daily total precipitation.
    The field in &quot;File A&quot; that gives the fraction of total precipitation
    that is convective is an estimate derived from the following two NARR precipitation
    fields (which are provided in &quot;File B&quot;): NARR total precipitation and
    NARR convective precipitation (the latter is less than or equal to the NARR total
    precipitation and can be zero). The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)
    is the final variable in the forcing dataset, also interpolated from NARR. The
    hourly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped into two GRIB files,
    &quot;File A&quot; and &quot;File B&quot;. &quot;File A&quot; is the primary (default)
    forcing file and contains eleven fields. The data set applies a user-defined parameter
    table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The following table shows
    a list of parameters, their Product Definition Section (PDS) IDs and units. PDS_IDs:Short_Name:Full_Name

  description: 'The National Ocean Service (NOS) maintains a long-term database containing
    water level measurements and derived tidal data for coastal waters of the United
    States and U.S. territories. These data allow for the determination and maintenance
    of vertical reference datums used for surveying and mapping, coastal construction,
    waterborne commerce, water level regulation, marine boundary determination, and
    tide prediction, and for the determination of long-term water level variations
    (e.g. trends). The data also supports other U.S. government programs, including
    the National Weather Service (NWS) Tsunami Warning System, the NWS storm surge
    monitoring programs, and the NOAA Climate and Global Change Program. The database
    contains an extended series of water level measurements recorded at different
    tide observation stations. These data are processed to generate a number of products,
    including monthly and yearly averages for mean tide level, mean sea level, diurnal
    tide level, mean high and low water, mean range, diurnal mean range, monthly extremes
    for high and low waters, and frequency and duration of inundations (the number
    of times and length of time at which the water level has equaled or exceeded a
    specific elevation for a period of analysis). Data are compiled for coastal waters
    of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and U.S. territories in
    the Pacific region. Water levels are monitored from a network of over 200 permanent,
    continuously operating tide observation stations and from numerous stations operated
    for short-term and long-term projects. Water level measurements are compiled for
    a variety of observation periods, depending upon the location. For some tide observation
    stations, records date back to the late 1800s. Observed water level values are
    compiled primarily at six minute increments. In addition, some stations provide
    real-time data for planning and emergency situations. The observed values are
    processed to generate mean and extreme values for different temporal intervals,
    as noted above. The data consist simply of elevations of water, in feet, observed
    at specific geographic locations and temporal periods. All water level measurements
    are referenced to staff ''0'' and can be referenced to other datums, such as the
    North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). Recent data are recorded to the
    hundredth of a foot; data collected prior to the mid-1960s are recorded to the
    tenth of a foot. The foundation of the water level database is the National Water
    Level Observation Network (NWLON), a system of long-term operating tide stations
    maintained by NOS. Data also are obtained through short-term and long-term cooperative
    projects with other federal, state, and local agencies and governments to accomplish
    mutual goals in water level measurement. For example, tide stations are operated
    temporarily for marine boundary determination and hydrographic survey projects.
    NOS also maintains several cooperative stations with foreign governments for the
    Climate and Global Change Program. Indices of tide stations maintained by NOS
    are available which include for each station the latitude, longitude, dates of
    observations, bench mark sheet publication date, and tidal epoch. NOS also issues
    tidal bench mark sheets upon completion of a data collection series or as needed
    for long-term NWLON stations. Tidal bench mark sheets provide location descriptions
    and vertical elevations referenced to tidal datums of the station bench marks.
    A table of tidal datums and the 1929 NGVD, when available, are referenced to the
    station reference datum. A number of products are issued monthly and annually,
    for free or on a cost recovery basis. The products are distributed on either hard
    copy, floppy disk, CD, or over the web and include the following: o Tide Observation
    Station Lists o Tides, 6-Minute Heights o Tides, Hourly Heights of Tides, Times
    and Heights of High and Low Waters o Tides, Monthly Mean Summaries o Tidal Bench

  description: 'Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (hereafter, GLDAS-2)
    has two components: one forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing
    data (hereafter, GLDAS-2.0), and the other forced with a combination of model
    and observation based forcing data sets (hereafter, GLDAS-2.1). This data set,
    GLDAS-2.0 1.0 degree 3-hourly, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated
    from the Noah Model 3.3, currently covers from 1948 to 2010 and will be extended
    to recent years as the data set becomes available. The model simulation was initialized
    on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields
    from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulation was forced by
    the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield
    et al., 2006). The simulation used the common GLDAS data sets for land cover (MCD12Q1:
    Friedl et al., 2010), land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009), soil texture
    (Reynolds, 1999), and elevation (GTOPO30). The MODIS based land surface parameters
    are used in the current GLDAS-2.x products while the AVHRR base parameters were
    used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012). The main
    objective for Version 2 is to create more climatologically consistent data sets
    using the Princeton forcing data sets extending from 1948. In Version 1, forcing
    sources switched several times throughout the record from 1979 to present, which
    introduced unnatural trends and exhibited highly uncertain forcing fields in 1995-1997.
    Other enhancements made in Version 2 include model version upgrade, switching
    to MODIS based land surface parameter data sets, and initialization of soil moisture
    over desert. In NOAH model, the bottom layer temperature data set was also updated.

    The GIS data sets were designed originally in ESRI's ARC/INFO ver. 8.0.1 and were
    published as part of a series of interim CD-ROM products of the U.S. Geological
    Survey's World Energy Project (WEP). The goal of the WEP is to assess the undiscovered,
    technically recoverable oil and gas resources of the world. Results of this assessment
    were reported in the year 2000 (see USGS DDS-60; http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds-060/).

  description: 'ABSTRACT: This data set provides two products that were derived from
    the recently published North American Carbon Program (NACP) Regional Synthesis
    1-degree terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) and inverse model (IM) outputs (Gridded
    1-deg Observation Data and Biosphere and Inverse Model Outputs, Wei et al., 2013).
    The first product is the aggregation of the standardized gridded 1-degree TBM
    and IM outputs to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory zones as defined for North
    America (United States, Canada, and Mexico). Depending on the data availability,
    the monthly/yearly Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Net Primary Production (NPP),
    Total Vegetation Carbon (VegC), Heterotrophic Respiration (Rh), and Fire Emissions
    (FE) outputs from the 22 TBM and 7 IM models were aggregated from the 1-degree
    resolution gridded format to the inventory zones and then, further divided into
    Forest Lands, Crop Lands, and Other Lands sectors within each inventory zone based
    on the 1-km resolution GLC2000 land cover map (GLC2000, 2003).The second product
    is the North American national GHG inventories on the scale of inventory zones
    which contain estimated land-atmosphere exchange of CO2 (NEE) in forest lands,
    crop lands, and other lands sectors. NEE estimates were synthesized from inventory-based
    data on productivity, ecosystem carbon stock change, and harvested product stock
    change, and additional information from national-level GHG inventories of the
    United States, Canada, and Mexico including EPA (2011) and Environment Canada
    (2011).An additional summary file of annual mean NEE (2000-2006)is provided for
    both land sectors and reporting zones in North America and was created by combining
    the aggregated model output and the national GHG database and is provided. The
    aggregated monthly and yearly model output data and the national GHG inventories
    data are available in comma separated value (*.csv) format files. Also provided
    are detailed inventory zone spatial data as an ESRI Shapefile. Included are zone
    names, boundaries, and zone and land cover type area attributes. For mapping convenience,
    the inventory zones shapefile was merged with 1-km forest, crop, and other lands
    masks to create a 1-km resolution reference data file that was converted to GeoTIFF
    format. The GeoTIFF defines to which inventory zone and land cover type each 1-km
    grid cell belongs.This document provides detailed information about the content,
    format, and processing procedures of these two data products. Detailed descriptions
    of the TBMs and IMs can be found in a separate companion document: NACP Regional
    Synthesis - Description of Observations and Models.'

  description: American Indian tribal subdivisions are administrative subdivisions
    of federally recognized American Indian reservations/off-reservation trust lands
    or Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs). These entities are internal units
    of self-government and/or administration that serve social, cultural, and/or economic
    purposes for the American Indian tribe or tribes on the reservations/off-reservation
    trust lands or OTSAs. The Census Bureau obtains the boundary and attribute information
    for tribal subdivisions on federally recognized American Indian reservations and
    off-reservation trust lands from federally recognized tribal governments through
    the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS) For the 2010 Census,
    the boundaries for tribal subdivisions on OTSAs were also obtained from federally
    recognized tribal governments through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP).
    Note that tribal subdivisions do not exist on all reservations/off-reservation
    trust lands or OTSAs, rather only where they were submitted to the Census Bureau
    by the federally recognized tribal government for that area. The boundaries for
    American Indian tribal subdivisions are as of January 1, 2013, as reported by
    the federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary
    and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries for tribal subdivisions on OTSAs are
    those reported as of January 1, 2010 through TSAP.

  description: "A natural consequence of groundwater withdrawals is the removal of
    water from subsurface storage, but the overall rates and magnitude of groundwater
    depletion in the United States are not well characterized. This study evaluates
    long-term cumulative depletion volumes in 40 separate aquifers or areas and one
    land use category in the United States, bringing together information from the
    literature and from new analyses. Depletion is directly calculated using calibrated
    groundwater models, analytical approaches, or volumetric budget analyses for multiple
    aquifer systems. Estimated groundwater depletion in the United States during 1900â\x80\x932008
    totals approximately 1,000 cubic kilometers (km3). Furthermore, the rate of groundwater
    depletion has increased markedly since about 1950, with maximum rates occurring
    during the most recent period (2000â\x80\x932008) when the depletion rate averaged
    almost 25 km3 per year (compared to 9.2 km3 per year averaged over the 1900â\x80\x932008
    timeframe)."

  description: This data set represents estimated soil variables compiled for every
    catchment of NHDPlus for the conterminous United States. The variables included
    are cation exchange capacity, percent calcium carbonate, slope, water-table depth,
    soil thickness, hydrologic soil group, soil erodibility (k-factor), permeability,
    average water capacity, bulk density, percent organic material, percent clay,
    percent sand, and percent silt. The source data set is the State Soil ( STATSGO
    ) Geographic Database (Wolock, 1997). The NHDPlus Version 1.1 is an integrated
    suite of application-ready geospatial datasets that incorporates many of the best
    features of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation
    Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,00-scale
    NHD), improved networking, naming, and value-added attributes (VAAs). NHDPlus
    also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage
    enforcement technique first widely used in New England, and thus referred to as
    "the New England Method." This technique involves "burning in" the 1:100,000-scale
    NHD and when available building "walls" using the National Watershed Boundary
    Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital elevation model (HydroDEM) is used
    to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHD and WBD. Over the past
    two years, an interdisciplinary team from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and
    the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and contractors, found that
    this method produces the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process
    (USEPA, 2007). The NHDPlus dataset is organized by 18 Production Units that cover
    the conterminous United States. The NHDPlus version 1.1 data are grouped by the
    U.S. Geologic Survey's Major River Basins (MRBs, Crawford and others, 2006). MRB1,
    covering the New England and Mid-Atlantic River basins, contains NHDPlus Production
    Units 1 and 2. MRB2, covering the South Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins,
    contains NHDPlus Production Units 3 and 6. MRB3, covering the Great Lakes, Ohio,
    Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy River basins, contains NHDPlus Production
    Units 4, 5, 7 and 9. MRB4, covering the Missouri River basins, contains NHDPlus
    Production Units 10-lower and 10-upper. MRB5, covering the Lower Mississippi,
    Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units
    8, 11 and 12. MRB6, covering the Rio Grande, Colorado and Great Basin River basins,
    contains NHDPlus Production Units 13, 14, 15 and 16. MRB7, covering the Pacific
    Northwest River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Unit 17. MRB8, covering California
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Unit 18.

  description: The U.S. Monthly Climate Normals for 1981 to 2010 are 30-year averages
    of meteorological parameters for thousands of U.S. stations located across the
    50 states, as well as U.S. territories, commonwealths, the Compact of Free Association
    nations, and one station in Canada. NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of
    data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate
    conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations
    as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program
    (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau
    Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate
    Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes
    various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum
    and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others),
    precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies
    and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including
    temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and
    cooling degree hours, pressure normals). In addition to the standard set of normals,
    users also can find "agricultural normals", which are used in many industries,
    including but not limited to construction, architecture, pest control, etc. These
    supplemental "agricultural normals" include frost-freeze date probabilities, growing
    degree day normals, probabilities of reaching minimum temperature thresholds,
    and growing season length normals. Users can access the data either by product
    or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe
    station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data.
    All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken
    from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical
    Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP).

  description: OBIS-USA provides aggregated, interoperable biogeographic data collected
    primarily from U.S. waters and oceanic regions--the Arctic, the Atlantic and Pacific
    oceans, the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes. It provides access
    to datasets from state and federal agencies as well as educational and research
    institutions. OBIS-USA handles both specimen-based data and survey results. Survey
    data come from recovered archives and current research activities. The datasets
    document where and when species were observed or collected, bringing together
    marine biogeographic data that are spatially, taxonomically, and temporally comprehensive.
    The public OBIS-USA site (http://www.usgs.gov/obis-usa) provides actual data contents
    as well as summary data about what is contained in each dataset to assist users
    in evaluating suitability for use. Current functionality allows the user to locate,
    view, and aggregate the datasets and FGDC compliant metadata as well as to view
    and search the taxonomic, geographic, and temporal extent. To promote data interoperability,
    the data are available in accordance with the marine-focused implementation of
    the Darwin Core data standard. In addition to basic download functions (tab-delimited),
    OBIS-USA offers web services for query flexibility and a wide range of output
    formats, such as kml, NetCDF, MATLAB, json, and graph or map output, to enable
    diverse types of scientific and geospatial data use and analysis platforms and
    products. OBIS-USA's two web services (ERDDAP and GeoServer) enable integration
    of OBIS-USA biogeographic data with other data types, such as seafloor geology,
    physical oceanography, water chemistry, and climate data. The NOAA Environmental
    Research Division Data Access Program(ERRDDAP) enables users to query scientific
    data by flexible parameters and obtain output in many formats. Access can be found
    at http://www1.usgs.gov/erddap/tabledap/AllMBG.html . OBIS-USA uses the tabledap
    component of ERDDAP to access Darwin-Core-type tabular spatial data; tabledap
    is a superset of the OPeNDAP DAP constraint protocol. OBIS-USA offers an ESRI
    REST Service with access to Darwin-Core-type point data at http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OBISUSA/OBIS_USA_All_Marine_Biogeographic_Records/MapServer/
    and an OGC compliant Web Mapping Service (wms) http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/services/OBISUSA/OBIS_USA_All_Marine_Biogeographic_Records/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS.
    OBIS-USA and collaborators are further deploying the Darwin Core standard to capture
    richer information, such as absence and abundance, observations on effort, individual
    tracking, and more advanced biogeography capabilities. Data are accepted into
    OBIS-USA from the data originator or holder, minimizing the burden on the participant.
    OBIS-USA works with data providers to understand the best process to transfer
    the data, review the data prior to their release, gather comprehensive metadata,
    and then allow public access to this information. Becoming part of the OBIS-USA
    network is intended to have tangible benefits for participants, for example, freeing
    the participant from responding to requests for data and alleviating security
    concerns since users do not directly access the participant's computers.

    represents the decade spanning 2000-2009. The data were generated by using the
    Hamon equation and output from ECHAM5, a fifth generation general circulation
    model created by the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg Germany.
    Data are at 2km x 2km resolution, and all data are stored in geotiffs. Calculations
    were performed using R 2.12.1 and 2.12.2 for Mac OS Leopard, and data were formatted
    into geotiffs using the raster and rgdal packages. Users are reminded that the
    PET estimates include the inherent uncertainty of model projections. In addition,
    the methods used to derive PET from temperature require a number of assumptions,
    which future conditions may or may not meet. In particular, these methods as implemented
    assume that cloudcover and relative humidity remain constant. This may or may
    not be true. Hamon Equation: These data were derived by applying the Hamon equation
    as outlined in Lu et al. (2005) to monthly average temperature downscaled by SNAP.'

    The ERS Food Expenditure Series contributes to the analysis of U.S. food production
    and consumption by constructing a comprehensive measure of the total value of
    all food expenditures by final purchasers. This series annually measures total
    U.S. food expenditures, including purchases by consumers, governments, businesses,
    and nonprofit organizations. Because the term expenditure is often associated
    with household decisionmaking, it is important to recognize that ERS's series
    also includes nonhousehold purchases. For example, the series includes the dollar
    value of domestic food purchases by military personnel and their dependents at
    military commissary stores and exchanges, the value of commodities and food dollars
    donated by the Federal government to schools, and the value of food purchased
    by airlines for serving during flights.

  description: This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated
    from the Mosaic land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North American Land
    Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing
    and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is monthly. The
    file format is WMO GRIB-1. The NLDAS-2 monthly Mosaic model data were generated
    from the NLDAS-2 hourly Mosaic model data, as monthly accumulation for rainfall,
    snowfall, subsurface runoff, surface runoff, total evapotranspiration, and snow
    melt, and monthly average for other variables. Monthly period of each month is
    from 00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z at end of the month, except the first
    month (Jan. 1979) that starts from 00Z 02 Jan 1979. Brief description about the
    NLDAS-2 monthly Mosaic model can be found from the GCMD DIF for NLDAS-2 hourly
    Mosaic data GES_DISC_NLDAS_MOS0125_H_V002 at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_MOS0125_H_V002.
    Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Mosaic LSM can be found in Xia
    et al. (2012). The NLDAS-2 monthly Mosaic model data contain thirty-seven fields.
    The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and
    parameter number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_MOS.002.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition

  description: 'ABSTRACT: This data set contains the original model output data submissions
    from the 24 terrestrial biosphere models (TBM) that participated in the North
    American Carbon Program (NACP) Site-Level Synthesis. The model teams generated
    estimates for, but not limited to, a minimum of six variables, including gross
    primary productivity (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), leaf area index (LAI),
    ecosystem respiration (Re), latent heat flux (LE), and sensible heat flux (H)
    for each of 47 selected eddy covariance flux tower sites across North America.
    Participating modeling teams followed the NACP Site Synthesis Protocol (site_synthesis_protocol_v7.pdf),
    which covers procedures, plans, and infrastructure for the site-level analyses.
    File format and units conversions of several data submissions were made by the
    MAST-DC to produce NetCDF files of consistent content and structure for all 24
    TBM outputs. The model outputs are structured as described in Appendix A: Model
    Output Variables, of the Site Synthesis Protocol. In addition, MAST-DC processed
    these original model submissions to derive uniquely processed and formatted data
    files for model inter-comparison and evaluation (NACP Site: Terrestrial Biosphere
    Model and Aggregated Flux Data in Standard Format). This related data set provides
    GPP, NEE, LAI, Re, LE, and sensible heat (H) model output variables at the native
    half-hourly time step, and in daily, monthly, and annual aggregations. The related
    data set also contains gap-filled observations and total uncertainty estimates
    at the same time steps.There are 24 compressed (*.zip) files with this data set
    -- one file for each model. When expanded, the .zip files contain model output
    data files for flux tower sites in NetCDF and some in text formats.'

    Resources Canada), Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática),
    and the United States (U.S. Geological Survey), as well as the North American
    Commission for Environmental Co-operation, has led to the release (June 2004)
    of several new products: an updated paper map of North America, and its associated
    geospatial data sets and their metadata. These data sets are available online
    from each of the partner countries both for visualization and download. The North
    American Atlas data are standardized geospatial data sets at 1:10,000,000 scale.
    A variety of basic data layers (e.g. roads, railroads, populated places, political
    boundaries, hydrography, bathymetry, sea ice and glaciers) have been integrated
    so that their relative positions are correct. This collection of data sets forms
    a base with which other North American thematic data may be integrated. Any data
    outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America included in the North
    American Atlas data sets is strictly to complete the context of the data. The
    North American Atlas \x96 Sea Ice data set shows the approximate extent of marine
    areas in the Arctic covered by permanent polar ice. The data originated from the
    Canadian Ice Service and was used in the 1:6,000,000 National Atlas of Canada
    Reference Map Series. It is represented by polygons showing the average minimum
    ice limit over a 30 year period, 1969-1999."

  description: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has generated a new classification
    and map of the lithology of surficial materials for the contiguous United States.
    This was developed as part of an effort to map standardized, terrestrial ecosystem
    distributions for the nation using a classification developed by NatureServe (Comer
    and others, 2003). This ecosystem mapping methodology, which delineates ecosystems
    by mapping and integrating their major structural components, was first developed
    for South America (Sayre and others, 2008) and is now being implemented globally
    (Sayre and others, 2007). Surficial lithology strongly influences the differentiation
    and distribution of terrestrial ecosystems, and is one of the key input layers
    in the ecosystem delineation process. These surficial lithology classes were derived
    from the USGS map "Surficial Materials in the Conterminous United States", which
    was based on texture, internal structure, thickness and environment of deposition
    or formation of materials (Soller and Reheis, 2004). This original map was produced
    from a compilation of regional surficial and bedrock geology source maps using
    broadly defined common map units for the purpose of providing an overview of the
    existing data and knowledge (Soller and Reheis 2004). For the national terrestrial
    ecosystem mapping effort, the original 28 lithology classes were reclassified
    into a set of 18 lithologies that typically control or influence the distribution
    of vegetation types (Kruckeberg, 2002).

  description: This film documents the activities that occurred on Drifting Station
    Alpha in the Arctic Ocean during the International Geophysical Year, 1957 to 1958.
    The film is narrated by project leader, Norbert Untersteiner, and chronicles the
    life of the team as they built their camp and set up experiments. Station Alpha
    was the first long-term scientific base on arctic pack ice operated by a Western
    country. At the time of its establishment, Russia had already operated six drifting
    ice camps of this kind. However, due to the strategic importance and sensitivity
    of the Arctic Basin, little information from these early stations had reached
    the West. The documentary was filmed and produced by Frans van der Hoeven (Senior
    Scientist at Station Alpha) and Norbert Untersteiner (Scientific Leader of Station
    Alpha). Station Alpha drifted in an area of the Arctic ocean located 500 km north
    of Barrow, Alaska USA from April 1957 to November 1958; the film covers this entire
    time period. Digitized copies of the film are available on DVD.

    were taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment
    Report and Rosenzweig et al. (2008). It consists of responses in the the physical,
    terrestrial biological systems and marine-ecosystems. The observations that were
    selected include data that demonstrate a statistically significant trend in change
    in either direction in systems related to temperature or other climate change
    variable, and the is for at least 20 years between 1970 and 2004, although study
    periods may extend earlier or later. For each observation, the data series is
    described in terms of system, region, longitude and latitude, dates and duration,
    statistical significance, type of impact, and whether or not land use was identified
    as a driving factor. System changes are taken from about 80 studies (of which
    about 75 are new since the IPCC Third Assessment Report) containing more than
    29,500 data series. Observations in the database are characterized as a change
    consistent with warming or a change not consistent with warming based on information
    from the underlying studies. The data is distributed by the Columbia University
    Center for Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN). (Suggested Usage: To provide

    The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing. The temporal resolution is monthly,
    ranging from January to December. The NLDAS-2 monthly climatology data are the
    monthly data averaged over the thirty years (1980 - 2009) of the NLDAS-2 monthly
    data. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. Brief description about the NLDAS-2 hourly
    and monthly primary forcing data can be found from the GCMD DIFs for GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORA0125_H_V002
    and GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORA0125_M_V002 at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORA0125_H_V002
    and http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORA0125_M_V002. Details
    about the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing datasets can be found in Xia et al.
    (2012). The monthly climatology land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped
    into two GRIB files, "File A" and "File B". "File A" is the primary (default)
    forcing file and contains eleven fields. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_FORA_hourly.002.txt)

  description: This raster, created in 2010, is output from the Geophysical Institute
    Permafrost Lab (GIPL) model and represents simulated mean annual ground temperature
    (MAGT) in Celsius, averaged across a decade, at the base of active layer or at
    the base of the seasonally frozen soil column. The file name specifies the decade
    the raster represents. For example, a file named MAGT_1980_1989.tif represents
    the decade spanning 1980-1989. Cell values represent simulated mean annual ground
    temperature (degree C) at the base of the active layer (for areas with permafrost)
    or at the base of the soil column that is seasonally frozen (for areas without
    permafrost). If the value of the cell is negative,the area has permafrost and
    the cell value specifies MAGT at the base of the active layer. If the value of
    the cell is positive, the ground is only seasonally frozen and the cell value
    specifies MAGT at the base of seasonal frost. The raster covers the entire state
    of Alaska and has a spatial resolution of 2 x 2km. These data were generated by
    forcing the GIPL model with a composite of five GCM model outputs (ECHAM5, GFLD21,
    MIROC, HADLEY and CCCMA) for the A1B emissions scenario.

  description: 'In response to the need and an intergovernmental commission for a
    high resolution and data-derived global ecosystem map, land surface elements of
    global ecological pattern were characterized in an ecophysiographic stratification
    of the planet. The stratification produced 3,923 terrestrial ecological land units
    (ELUs) at a base resolution of 250 meters. The ELUs were derived from data on
    land surface features in a three step approach. The first step involved acquiring
    or developing four global raster datalayers representing the primary components
    of ecosystem structure: bioclimate, landform, lithology, and land cover. These
    datasets generally represent the most accurate, current, globally comprehensive,
    and finest spatial and thematic resolution data available for each of the four
    inputs. The second step involved a spatial combination of the four inputs into
    a single, new integrated raster dataset where every cell represents a combination
    of values from the bioclimate, landforms, lithology, and land cover datalayers.
    This foundational global raster datalayer, called ecological facets (EFs), contains
    47,650 unique combinations of the four inputs. The third step involved an aggregation
    of the EFs into the 3,923 ELUs.'

    of meteorological parameters that provide users with many tools to understand
    typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States,
    as well as U.S. territories, commonwealths, the Compact of Free Association nations,
    and one station in Canada. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including
    those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some
    additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification
    number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). THe Annual
    Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products such as daily air temperature
    normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling
    degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and
    snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal
    derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill,
    wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). All data
    utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the
    ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical
    Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP).
    These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation
    of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.

  description: 'This shapefile represents seasonal winter average net power estimates.
    The OTEC Plant model predicts the net power production at a specific location,
    given three inputs: surface temperature (°C), depth (m), and difference between
    warm surface water temperature and cold deep sea water temperature (ΔT in °C)
    at the given depth, relative to the surface temperature. In order to normalize
    values for the purposes of visualization of the OTEC resource around the world,
    a baseline plant design was used. The baseline 100MW Net Power design has been
    optimized for conditions indicative of the Hawai‘i OTEC resource. As such, power
    output as described by the results of this study is not optimized for local conditions
    (except in parts of Hawai’i), but does provide guidance for site selection. Given
    the nominal plant power output of 100MW based on a competitive cost of electricity
    (Hawai’i), any output exceeding this value represents significant potential. A
    large area of predicted 100 MW+ net power exists in many locations around the
    world, especially in areas with high energy costs. Data were processed and converted
    to shapefile format by NREL for the [Ocean Thermal Extractable Energy Visualization](http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/1055457/1055457.pdf)

  description: The AVHRR Pathfinder Version 5.2 Sea Surface Temperature data set (PFV52)
    is a collection of global, twice-daily 4km sea surface temperature data produced
    in a partnership by the NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center and the University
    of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. PFV52 was computed
    from data from the AVHRR instruments on board NOAA's polar orbiting satellite
    series using an entirely modernized system based on SeaDAS (NASA SeaWiFS Data
    Analysis System). This system incorporates several key changes from Versions 5.0
    and 5.1 of Pathfinder, including the use of an entirely new land mask, a modified
    grid, and the inclusion of sea ice, wind speed, and aerosol ancillary data to
    support the use of the SST data. Importantly, PFV52 data are provided in netCDF-4
    (classic model, with internal compression and chunking) and are nearly 100% compliant
    with the GHRSST (Group for High-Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) Data Specification
    Version 2.0 for L3C products. These data deviate from that standard only in that
    sses_bias, sses_standard_deviation, and sst_dtime variables are empty. PFV52 data
    were collected through the operational periods of the NOAA-7 through NOAA-18 Polar
    Operational Environmental Satellites (POES), and are available for 1981 through
    2010. Data for all years are available as separate NODC accessions.

  description: 'Beach erosion is a chronic problem along most open-ocean shores of
    the United States. As coastal populations continue to grow, and community infrastructures
    are threatened by erosion, there is increased demand for accurate information
    regarding past and present shoreline changes. There is also need for a comprehensive
    analysis of shoreline movement that is regionally consistent. To meet these national
    needs, the USGS National Assessment of Shoreline Change Project has collected
    and analyzed a comprehensive database of digital vector shorelines by compiling
    shoreline positions from pre-existing historical shoreline databases and by generating
    historical and modern shoreline data. This dataset consists of long-term (100+
    years) shoreline change rates. Rate calculations were computed using the Digital
    Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), an ArcGIS extension developed by the U.S. Geological
    Survey. Long-term rates of shoreline change were calculated using a linear regression
    rate based on all available shoreline data. A reference baseline was used as the
    originating point for the orthogonal transects cast by the DSAS software. The
    transects intersect each shoreline establishing measurement points, which are
    then used to calculate long-term rates. To make these results more accessible
    to the public and other agencies, the USGS created this web service. This web
    service was created utilizing ESRI ArcServer. This service meets open geospatial
    consortium standards. The data compilation used to derive the shoreline change
    rates is available in a service with the title USGS Map service: National Shoreline
    Change - Historic Shorelines by State. The reference baseline used to derive the
    shoreline change rates is available in a service with the title USGS Map service:
    National Shoreline Change - Offshore Baseline. The locations of the transects
    used in the change rate calculation are available in a service with the title
    USGS Map service: National Shoreline Change - Intersection Points. The geographic
    information system (GIS) data layers from this web service are cataloged by state
    for ease of access.'

  description: This EnviroAtlas dataset contains data on the mean cultivated biological
    nitrogen fixation (C-BNF) in cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands per 12-digit
    Hydrologic Unit (HUC) in 2006. N inputs from the cultivation of legumes, which
    possess a symbiotic relationship with N fixing bacteria, were calculated with
    a recently developed model relating county-level yields of various leguminous
    crops with BNF rates. We accessed county-level data on annual crop yields for
    soybeans (Glycine max L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), peanuts (Arachis hypogaea
    L.), various dry beans (Phaseolus, Cicer, and Lens spp.), and dry peas (Pisum
    spp.) for 2006 from the USDA Census of Agriculture (http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/index.php).
    We estimated the yield of the non-alfalfa leguminous component of hay as 32% of
    the yield of total non-alfalfa hay (http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/index.php). Annual
    rates of C-BNF by crop type were calculated using a model that relates yield to
    C-BNF. We assume yield data reflect differences in soil properties, water availability,
    temperature, and other local and regional factors that can influence root nodulation
    and rate of N fixation. We distributed county-specific, C-BNF rates to cultivated
    crop and hay/pasture lands delineated in the 2006 National Land Cover Database
    (30 x 30 m pixels) within the corresponding county. C-BNF data described here
    represent an average input to a typical agricultural land type within a county,
    i.e., they are not specific to individual crop types. This dataset was produced
    by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas.

    Alaskan Native Areas and Hawaiian Home Lands. The SF1 data are available on the
    Bureau''s web site and may be retrieved from American FactFinder as tables, lists,
    or maps. Users may also download a set of compressed ASCII files for each state
    via the Bureau''s FTP server. There are over 8000 data items available for each
    geographic area. The full listing of these data items is available here as a downloadable
    compressed data base file named TABLES.ZIP. The uncompressed is in FoxPro data
    base file (dbf) format and may be imported to ACCESS, EXCEL, and other software
    formats. While all of this information is useful, the Office of Community Planning
    and Development has downloaded selected information for all states and areas and
    is making this information available on the CPD web pages. The tables and data
    items selected are those items used in the CDBG and HOME allocation formulas plus
    topics most pertinent to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS),
    the Consolidated Plan, and similar overall economic and community development
    plans. The information is contained in five compressed (zipped) dbf tables for
    each state. When uncompressed the tables are ready for use with FoxPro and they
    can be imported into ACCESS, EXCEL, and other spreadsheet, GIS and database software.
    The data are at the block group summary level. The first two characters of the
    file name are the state abbreviation. The next two letters are BG for block group.
    Each record is labeled with the code and name of the city and county in which
    it is located so that the data can be summarized to higher-level geography. The
    last part of the file name describes the contents . The GEO file contains standard
    Census Bureau geographic identifiers for each block group, such as the metropolitan
    area code and congressional district code. The only data included in this table
    is total population and total housing units. POP1 and POP2 contain selected population
    variables and selected housing items are in the HU file. The MA05 table data is
    only for use by State CDBG grantees for the reporting of the racial composition
    of beneficiaries of Area Benefit activities. The complete package for a state
    consists of the dictionary file named TABLES, and the five data files for the
    state. The logical record number (LOGRECNO) links the records across tables.'

    Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range
    from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is monthly. The file format
    is WMO GRIB-1. The NLDAS-2 monthly VIC model data were generated from the NLDAS-2
    hourly VIC model data, as monthly accumulation for rainfall, snowfall, subsurface
    runoff, surface runoff, total evapotranspiration, and snow melt, and monthly average
    for other variables. Monthly period of each month is from 00Z at start of the
    month to 23:59Z at end of the month, except the first month (Jan. 1979) that starts
    from 00Z 02 Jan 1979. Also for the first month (Jan 1979), because the variables
    listed as instantaneous in the README file (http://hydro1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/s4pa/NLDAS/README.NLDAS2.pdf)
    do not have valid data exactly on 00Z 02 Jan 1979, this one hour is not included
    in the average for this month only. Brief description about the NLDAS-2 hourly
    VIC model data can be found from the GCMD DIF for GES_DISC_NLDAS_VIC0125_H_V002
    at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_VIC0125_H_V002. Details
    about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the VIC LSM can be found in Xia et al. (2012).
    The version of the VIC model for the NLDAS-2 VIC data available from the NASA
    GES DISC is VIC-4.0.3; this version of the VIC model is the same as used in Sheffield
    et al. (2003). The NLDAS-2 VIC monthly data contain forty-three fields. The data
    set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter
    number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_VIC.002.txt)

  description: 'The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has generated topographic moisture
    potential classes for the contiguous United States. These topographic moisture
    potential classes were created as part of an effort to map standardized, terrestrial
    ecosystems for the nation using a classification developed by NatureServe (Comer
    and others, 2003). Ecosystem distributions were modeled using a biophysical stratification
    approach developed for South America (Sayre and others, 2008) and now being implemented
    globally (Sayre and others, 2007). Substrate moisture regimes strongly influence
    the differentiation and distribution of terrestrial ecosystems, and are one of
    the key input layers in the ecosystem delineation process. The method used to
    produce these classes is based on the derivation of ground moisture potential
    using a combination of computed topographic characteristics and mapped wetlands
    boundaries. This method does not use climate or soil attributes to calculate relative
    topographic moisture potential since these characteristics are incorporated into
    the ecosystems though other input layers. The source data for this assessment
    is a national Compound Topographic Index (CTI) dataset (USGS Earth Resources Observation
    and Science Center, 2003), which was derived from the USGS 30-meter National Elevation
    Dataset (NED). The CTI index is a topographically derived measure of slope for
    a raster cell and the contributing area from "upstream" raster cells, and thus
    expresses potential for water flow to a point. This potential accumulation at
    a point was compared to independent estimates of water accumulation by obtaining
    geospatial data from a number of sample locations representing wetland/upland
    boundaries from the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) dataset. Where these "shorelines"
    (the interface between wetlands and adjacent land) occurred, the CTI values were
    extracted and a histogram of their statistical distributions was calculated. Based
    on an evaluation of these histograms, CTI thresholds were developed to separate
    wetlands from uplands. A similar process was used to assess the distributions
    of CTI values for known locations of mesic and dry uplands. After the range of
    CTI values for these three different substrate moisture regimes (wetlands, mesic
    uplands, and dry uplands) was determined, the CTI values were recalculated to
    topographic moisture potential. The final step in the generation of the national
    topographic moisture potential data layer was to partition the dry uplands class
    into two classes, a dry uplands class, and a very dry uplands class. Very dry
    uplands were defined as dry uplands with relatively steep, south-facing slopes,
    and identification of this class was based on the slope and aspect datasets derived
    from the USGS NED. The resulting Topographic Moisture Potential dataset for the
    contiguous United States contains four classes: wetlands, mesic uplands, dry uplands,
    and very dry uplands.'

    classification schemes based primarily on Landsat satellite data along with ancillary
    data sources, such as topography, census and agricultural statistics, soil characteristics,
    wetlands, and other land cover maps. NLCD 1992 is a 21-class land cover classification
    scheme that has been applied consistently across the conterminous U.S. at a spatial
    resolution of 30 meters. NLCD 2001 is a 16-class land cover classification scheme
    that also has been applied to the conterminous U.S. at a spatial resolution of
    30 meters, and includes Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. NLCD 2006 quantified
    land cover change for the conterminous U.S. between the years 2001 to 2006. Generation
    of NLCD 2006 helped identify and correct issues in the 2001 land cover and impervious
    surface products only, and no changes were made to the 2001 canopy product. NLCD
    2011 is the most recent national land cover product based primarily on a decision-tree
    classification of 2011 Landsat satellite data. The National Map viewer allows
    free downloads of public domain, 30-meter resolution land cover data by 3x3 degree
    tiles in GeoTIFF format for the United States and Puerto Rico. For additional

  description: 'Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (hereafter, GLDAS-2)
    has two components: one forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing
    data (hereafter, GLDAS-2.0), and the other forced with a combination of model
    and observation based forcing data sets (hereafter, GLDAS-2.1). This data set,
    GLDAS-2.0 0.25 degree 3-hourly, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated
    from the Noah Model 3.3, currently covers from 1948 to 2010 and will be extended
    to recent years as the data set becomes available. The model simulation was initialized
    on simulation date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields
    from the LSM climatology for that day of the year. The simulation was forced by
    the global meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield
    et al., 2006). The simulation used the common GLDAS data sets for land cover (MCD12Q1:
    Friedl et al., 2010), land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009), soil texture
    (Reynolds, 1999), and elevation (GTOPO30). The MODIS based land surface parameters
    are used in the current GLDAS-2.x products while the AVHRR base parameters were
    used in GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012). The main
    objective for Version 2 is to create more climatologically consistent data sets
    using the Princeton forcing data sets extending from 1948. In Version 1, forcing
    sources switched several times throughout the record from 1979 to present, which
    introduced unnatural trends and exhibited highly uncertain forcing fields in 1995-1997.
    Other enhancements made in Version 2 include model version upgrade, switching
    to MODIS based land surface parameter data sets, and initialization of soil moisture
    over desert. In NOAH model, the bottom layer temperature data set was also updated.
    More details regarding the land surface parameter data changes at http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas/.
    WGRIB or other GRIB reader is required to read the files. The data set applies
    a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter numbers.
    The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_GLDAS_V2.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition
    Section (PDS) IDs and units. There are four vertical levels for the Soil Moisture
    (PDS 086) and Soil Temperature (PDS 085) in the Noah GRIBT files. For more information,

  description: The Global Hourly Summaries are simple indicators of observational
    normals which include climatic data summarizations and frequency distributions.
    These typically are statistical analyses of station data over 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-year
    or longer time periods. In a GIS map service, the results of these calculations
    are represented by a given symbology set for different statistical criteria and
    observation type. Having the ability to modify the symbology "on-the-fly" is a
    useful tool in the analysis of station trends, accuracy, and regional or localized
    variances. The summaries are computed from the global surface hourly dataset.
    This dataset totaling over 350 gigabytes is comprised of 40 different types of
    weather observations with 20,000 stations worldwide. NCDC and the U.S. Navy have
    developed these value added products in the form of hourly summaries from many
    of these observations. These data are a subset of the Integrated Surface Hourly
    dataset (DSI-3505) (C00532).

  description: 'ABSTRACT: A comprehensive global database has been assembled to quantify
    CO2 fluxes and pathways across different levels of integration (from photosynthesis
    up to net ecosystem production) in forest ecosystems. The database fills an important
    gap for model calibration, model validation, and hypothesis testing at global
    and regional scales. The database archive includes: a Microsoft Office Access
    Database; data files for all tables in the database; query outputs from the database;
    and SQL script file for re-creating the database from the tables. The database
    is structured by site (i.e., a forest or stand of known geographical location,
    biome, species composition, and management regime). It contains carbon budget
    variables (fluxes and stocks), ecosystem traits (standing biomass, leaf area index,
    age), and ancillary information (management regime, climate, soil characteristics)
    for 529 sites from eight forest biomes. Data entries originated from peer-reviewed
    literature and personal communications with researchers involved in Fluxnet. Flux
    estimates were included in the database when they were based on direct measurements
    (e.g., tower-based eddy covariance system measurements), derived from single or
    multiple direct measurements, or modeled. Stand description was based on observed
    values, and climatic description was based on the CRU data set and ORCHIDEE model
    output. Uncertainty for each carbon balance component in the database was estimated
    in a uniformed way by expert judgment. Robustness of CO2 balances was tested,
    and closure terms were introduced as a numerical way to approach data quality
    and flux uncertainty at the biome level.'

  description: This data set represents the average population density, in number
    of people per square kilometer multiplied by 10 for the year 2000, compiled for
    every catchment of NHDPlus for the conterminous United States. The source data
    set is the 2000 Population Density by Block Group for the Conterminous United
    States (Hitt, 2003). The NHDPlus Version 1.1 is an integrated suite of application-ready
    geospatial datasets that incorporates many of the best features of the National
    Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus
    includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,00-scale NHD), improved networking,
    naming, and value-added attributes (VAAs). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived
    catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first
    widely used in New England, and thus referred to as "the New England Method."
    This technique involves "burning in" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available
    building "walls" using the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting
    modified digital elevation model (HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives
    that agree with the NHD and WBD. Over the past two years, an interdisciplinary
    team from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (USEPA), and contractors, found that this method produces the best quality
    NHD catchments using an automated process (USEPA, 2007). The NHDPlus dataset is
    organized by 18 Production Units that cover the conterminous United States. The
    NHDPlus version 1.1 data are grouped by the U.S. Geologic Survey's Major River
    Basins (MRBs, Crawford and others, 2006). MRB1, covering the New England and Mid-Atlantic
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 1 and 2. MRB2, covering the South
    Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 3
    and 6. MRB3, covering the Great Lakes, Ohio, Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 4, 5, 7 and 9. MRB4, covering
    the Missouri River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 10-lower and 10-upper.
    MRB5, covering the Lower Mississippi, Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River
    basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 8, 11 and 12. MRB6, covering the Rio
    Grande, Colorado and Great Basin River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units
    13, 14, 15 and 16. MRB7, covering the Pacific Northwest River basins, contains
    NHDPlus Production Unit 17. MRB8, covering California River basins, contains NHDPlus
    Production Unit 18.

  description: This EnviroAtlas dataset contains data on the mean livestock manure
    application to cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands by 12-digit Hydrologic Unit
    (HUC) in 2006. Livestock manure inputs to cultivated crop and hay/pasture lands
    were estimated using county-level estimates of recoverable animal manure from
    confined feeding operations compiled for 2007. Recoverable manure is defined as
    manure that is collected, stored, and available for land application from confined
    feeding operations. County-scale data on livestock populations-needed to calculate
    manure inputs-were only available for the year 2007 from the USDA Census of Agriculture
    (http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/index.php). We acquired county-level data describing
    total farm-level inputs (kg N/yr) of recoverable manure to individual counties
    in 2007 from the International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) Nutrient Geographic
    Information System (NuGIS; http://www.ipni.net/nugis). These data were converted
    to per area rates (kg N/ha/yr) of manure N inputs by dividing the total N input
    by the land area (ha) of combined cultivated crop and hay/pasture (agricultural)
    lands within a county as determined from county-level summarization of the 2006
    NLCD. We distributed county-specific, per area N inputs rates to cultivated crop
    and hay/pasture lands (30 x 30 m pixels) within the corresponding county. Manure
    data described here represent an average input to a typical agricultural land
    type within a county, i.e., they are not specific to individual crop types. This
    dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities
    related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas) allows
    the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application to view
    and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States. The
    dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas)
    or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each
    attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet

    birds identified to species. Survey points, or sites, were located approximately
    500 m apart and observations of birds were limited to a maximum distance of 250
    m to prevent double counting. We visited each survey site 2–3 times and assumed
    community closure within the survey period. Mean interval (±SD) between site-specific
    surveys was 5.8 ± 2.4 days. We measured 13 vegetative characteristics at 10 subsampling
    points associated with each bird survey location during 26 June – 11 July 2012.
    Five subsampling plots were located along each of two 20-m transects with random
    orientation (0–359 degrees). One transect originated at the bird survey point,
    and the other at a point selected randomly within 250 m of the bird survey point.
    At each subsampling point, we estimated overlapping coverages within six vegetation
    classes, including alder (Alnus spp.), dwarf birch (Betula spp.), ericaceous shrubs
    (e.g., Empetrum, Vaccinium spp.), herbaceous, lichen (e.g., Cladonia spp.), and
    willow (Salix spp.) using a 0.5-m2 quadrat frame, and recorded the height of the
    tallest plant of each type within the sampling frame. We recorded visual obstruction
    (VOR), an index of vegetation of height and density, at each subsampling point
    measured from a distance of 2 m and at a height of 0.5 m. Analyses of these data
    are published in: McNew, L. B., and C. M. Handel. 2015. Evaluating species richness:

  description: Digital elevation models (DEMs) of U.S. coasts that integrate ocean
    bathymetry and land topography to support NOAA's mission to understand and predict
    changes in Earth's environment, and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources
    to meet our Nation's economic, social, and environmental needs. These models,
    built and distributed by NOAA?s National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), utilize
    bathymetric, topographic, and shoreline data obtained from various sources, including
    NGDC, the U.S. National Ocean Service (NOS), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),
    the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Federal Emergency Management Agency
    (FEMA), and other federal, state, and local government agencies, academic institutions,
    and private companies. DEMs are referenced to a variety of vertical tidal datums,
    generally mean high water (MHW) or North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD
    88), and a horizontal datum of North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) or World
    Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). DEM cell sizes range from high-resolution models
    (1/9 to 1/3 arc-second; ~3 to 10 meters) that support coastal inundation studies,
    to regional models (roughly 3 to 24 arc-seconds) that extend farther offshore,
    to global models (1 arc-minute; ~2 km).

  description: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a compilation and evaluation of the
    inputs, outputs and potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout
    its life cycle. LCA describes the life cycle as consecutive and interlinked stages
    of a product system extending from the acquisition of raw materials through materials
    processing, technology manufacturing/construction, technology use/maintenance/upgrade,
    and the technology retirement. LCA also provides a framework for understanding
    economic and social impacts. In an LCA, data are collected at the unit process
    level, intended to represent a single industrial activity, in this case the food
    and agriculture industry. Each single industrial activity (a) produces product
    and sometimes co-products; (b) uses resources from the environment; (c) uses resources
    from other unit processes in the technosphere; and (d) generates emissions to
    the environment. In an LCA, the inventory analysis combines unit process data
    for the life cycle and the impact assessment estimates the impact associated with
    activities and flows to and from the environment for the inventory. Datasets have
    been developed for the LCA Commons in response to a national need for data representing
    US operations. The LCA Commons database is an open access database developed by
    the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Library
    (NAL) for use in LCAs to support policy assessment, technology implementation
    decision-making, and publicly disclosed comparative product or technology assertions.

  description: 'Gridded Population of the World, Version 2 (GPWv2) consists of estimates
    of human population for the years 1995 and 1990 by 2.5 arc-minute grid cells.
    The data products are population counts (raw counts), population densities (per
    square km), and land area (actual area net of ice and water), all of which are
    available in two GIS-compatible data formats at the global, continent (Antarctica
    not included), and country levels. A proportional allocation gridding algorithm,
    utilizing 127,105 national and sub-national administrative units, is used to assign
    population values to grid cells. Advantages to GPWv2 include higher quality data
    from the U.S., Africa, Australia, Canada, Europe, Russia, New Zealand, and India;
    8 times the number of administrative units; national population estimates that
    have been adjusted to match the United Nations national estimated population for
    each country; a proportional allocation algorithm that reduces error with multiple
    input polygons; and higher spatial resolution. GPWv2 is produced by the Columbia
    University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)
    in collaboration with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
    and the World Resources Institute (WRI). (Suggested Usage: To serve a wide user
    community by providing the latest data on human population distribution that can
    be used in interdisciplinary studies of the environment.)'

  description: 'This data product contains avian point-transect survey data and habitat
    data collected on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska, USA, during 21 May – 10 June 2012.
    We conducted replicated 10-min surveys at 111 points located along 9 transects
    occurring over gradients of physical and biotic habitat conditions and recorded
    observations of individual birds identified to species. Survey points, or sites,
    were located approximately 500 m apart and observations of birds were limited
    to a maximum distance of 250 m to prevent double counting. We visited each survey
    site 2–3 times and assumed community closure within the survey period. Mean interval
    (±SD) between site-specific surveys was 5.8 ± 2.4 days. We measured 13 vegetative
    characteristics at 10 subsampling points associated with each bird survey location
    during 26 June – 11 July 2012. Five subsampling plots were located along each
    of two 20-m transects with random orientation (0–359 degrees). One transect originated
    at the bird survey point, and the other at a point selected randomly within 250
    m of the bird survey point. At each subsampling point, we estimated overlapping
    coverages within six vegetation classes, including alder (Alnus spp.), dwarf birch
    (Betula spp.), ericaceous shrubs (e.g., Empetrum, Vaccinium spp.), herbaceous,
    lichen (e.g., Cladonia spp.), and willow (Salix spp.) using a 0.5-m2 quadrat frame,
    and recorded the height of the tallest plant of each type within the sampling
    frame. We recorded visual obstruction (VOR), an index of vegetation of height
    and density, at each subsampling point measured from a distance of 2 m and at
    a height of 0.5 m. Analyses of these data are published in: McNew, L. B., and

  description: The Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) is a weather forecast model
    made up of 21 separate forecasts, or ensemble members. The National Centers for
    Environmental Prediction (NCEP) started the GEFS to address the nature of uncertainty
    in weather observations, which are used to initialize weather forecast models.
    The proverbial butterfly flapping her wings can have a cascading effect leading
    to wind gusts thousands of miles away. This extreme example illustrates that tiny,
    unnoticeable differences between reality and what is actually measured can, over
    time, lead to noticeable differences between what a weather model forecast predicts
    and reality itself. The GEFS attempts to quantify the amount of uncertainty in
    a forecast by generating an ensemble of multiple forecasts, each minutely different,
    or perturbed, from the original observations. With global coverage, GEFS is produced
    four times a day with weather forecasts going out to 16 days and a 6 hour temporal
    resolution. This dataset has 1.0 degree horizontal resolution.

  description: This monthly climatology data set contains a series of land surface
    parameters simulated from the Mosaic land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the
    North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th
    degree grid spacing. The temporal resolution is monthly, ranging from January
    to December. The NLDAS-2 monthly climatology data are the monthly data averaged
    over the thirty years (1980 - 2009) of the NLDAS-2 monthly data. The file format
    is WMO GRIB-1. Brief description about the NLDAS-2 hourly and monthly Mosaic LSM
    data can be found from the GCMD DIFs for GES_DISC_NLDAS_MOS0125_H_V002 and GES_DISC_NLDAS_MOS0125_M_V002

    Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Mosaic LSM can be found in Xia
    et al. (2012). The NLDAS-2 Mosaic model monthly climatology data set contains
    thirty-seven fields. The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate
    the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_MOS.002.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition
    Section (PDS) IDs and units. There are six vertical levels for the Soil Moisture
    (PDS 086) in the Mosaic GRIB files. For more information, please see the README

  description: 'Beach erosion is a chronic problem along most open-ocean shores of
    the United States. As coastal populations continue to grow, and community infrastructures
    are threatened by erosion, there is increased demand for accurate information
    regarding past and present shoreline changes. There is also need for a comprehensive
    analysis of shoreline movement that is regionally consistent. To meet these national
    needs, the USGS National Assessment of Shoreline Change Project has collected
    and analyzed a comprehensive database of digital vector shorelines by compiling
    shoreline positions from pre-existing historical shoreline databases and by generating
    historical and modern shoreline data. This dataset includes a reference baseline
    used by the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to calculate rate-of-change
    statistics. This baseline layer serves as the starting point for all transects
    cast by the DSAS application. The resulting rates of change are available in services
    with the titles USGS Map service: National Shoreline Change - Long-Term Shoreline
    Change Rates and USGS Map service: National Shoreline Change - Short-Term Shoreline
    Change Rates. To make this shoreline data more accessible to the public and other
    agencies, the USGS created this web service. This web service was created utilizing
    ESRI ArcServer. This service meets open geospatial consortium standards. The geographic
    information system (GIS) data layers from this web service are cataloged by state
    for ease of access.'

  description: The Sea Ice Edge Location and Extent in the Russian Arctic, 1933-2006
    data are derived from sea ice charts from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute
    (AARI), St. Petersburg, Russia. Provided here are sea ice edge locations, where
    identifiable, in each AARI ice chart and monthly and seasonal mean sea ice extents
    for each of the marginal seas in the Russian Arctic derived from these ice edges.
    The original AARI charts were constructed primarily to assist operations in the
    Northern Sea Route. The digital version, from which this data set is derived,
    is titled Sea Ice Charts of the Russian Arctic in Gridded Format, 1933-2006.Spatial
    and temporal coverage vary. There is generally a chart every 10 days. However,
    the early part of the series only covers summer; in later years, coverage is year
    round. Sea ice edge position is given in decimal degrees (latitude at every degree
    longitude from about 30째 W to 150째 W going from west to east) for each of the
    2877 ice charts. Landfast ice edge, multiyear ice edge, and pack ice edge data
    are available. Total ice cover and multiyear ice cover mean sea ice extent data,

  description: The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a weather forecast model produced
    by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Dozens of atmospheric
    and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures,
    winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration.
    The entire globe is covered by the GFS at a base horizontal resolution of 18 miles
    (28 kilometers) between grid points, which is used by the operational forecasters
    who predict weather out to 16 days in the future. Horizontal resolution drops
    to 44 miles (70 kilometers) between grid point for forecasts between one week
    and two weeks. The GFS model is a coupled model, composed of four separate models
    (an atmosphere model, an ocean model, a land/soil model, and a sea ice model),
    which work together to provide an accurate picture of weather conditions. Changes
    are regularly made to the GFS model to improve its performance and forecast accuracy.
    This dataset is run four times daily at 00z, 06z, 12z and 18z out to 192 hours
    with a 0.5 degree horizontal resolution and a 3 hour temporal resolution.

  description: This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated
    from the VIC land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North American Land Data
    Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range
    from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly. The file format
    is WMO GRIB-1. Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the VIC LSM can be found
    in Xia et al. (2012). The version of the VIC model for the NLDAS-2 VIC data available
    from the NASA GES DISC is VIC-4.0.3; this version of the VIC model is the same
    as used in Sheffield et al. (2003). The VIC model was developed at the University
    of Washington and Princeton University as a macroscale, semi-distributed, grid-based,
    hydrologic model [Liang et al., 1994; Wood et al., 1997]. The full water and energy
    balance modes of VIC were used for NLDAS-2. VIC uses three soil layers, with thicknesses
    that vary spatially. The root zone depends on the vegetation type and its root
    distribution, and can span all three soil layers. The VIC model includes a two-layer
    energy balance snow model [Cherkauer et al., 2003]. The VIC LSM was forced by
    the hourly NLDAS-2 forcing "File A" files, and contains forty-three fields. The
    data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter
    number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_VIC.002.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition
    Section (PDS) IDs and units. For information about the vertical layers of the
    Soil Moisture Content (PDS 086), Soil Temperature (PDS 085), and Liquid Soil Moisture

  description: The coastal vulnerability index (CVI)provides a preliminary overview,
    at a National scale, of the relative susceptibility of the Nation's coast to sea-level
    rise. This initial classification is based upon variables including geomorphology,
    regional coastal slope, tide range, wave height, relative sea-level rise, and
    shoreline erosion and accretion rates. The combination of these variables and
    the association of these variables to each other furnish a broad overview of coastal
    regions where physical changes are likely to occur due to sea-level rise. To make
    this coastal vulnerability index data more accessible to the public and other
    agencies, the USGS created this web service. This web service was created utilizing
    ESRI ArcServer. Vector layers were collected, organized by the coastal regions
    of the U.S., U.S. Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf of Mexico Coasts, and symbology made
    consistent among similar data sets. This service meets open geospatial consortium
    standards. The geographic information system (GIS) data layers from this web service
    are cataloged by region for ease of access.

  description: 'The locations of approximately 23,000 current and historical U.S.
    Geological Survey (USGS) streamgages in the United States and Puerto Rico (with
    the exception of Alaska) have been snapped to the medium resolution National Hydrography
    Dataset (NHD). The NHD contains geospatial information about mapped surface-water
    features, such as streams, lakes, and reservoirs, etc., creating a hydrologic
    network that can be used to determine what is upstream or downstream from a point
    of interest on the NHD network. An automated snapping process made the initial
    determination of the NHD location of each streamgage. These initial NHD locations
    were comprehensively reviewed by local USGS personnel to ensure that streamgages
    were snapped to the correct NHD reaches. About 75 percent of the streamgages snapped
    to the appropriate NHD reach location initially and 25 percent required adjustment
    and relocation. This process resulted in approximately 23,000 gages being successfully
    snapped to the NHD. This dataset contains the latitude and longitude coordinates
    of the point on the NHD to which the streamgage is snapped and the location of
    the gage house for each streamgage. A process known as indexing may be used to
    create reference points (event tables) to the NHD reaches, expressed as a reach
    code and measure (distance along the reach). Indexing is dependent on the version
    of NHD to which the indexing is referenced. These data are well suited for use
    in indexing because nearly all the streamgage NHD locations have been reviewed
    and adjusted if necessary, to ensure they will index to the appropriate NHD reach.
    Flow characteristics were computed from the daily streamflow data recorded at
    each streamgage for the period of record. The flow characteristics associated
    with each streamgage include: First date (year, month, day) of streamflow data
    Last date (year, month, day) of streamflow data Number of days of streamflow data
    Number of days of non-zero streamflow data Minimum and maximum daily flow for
    the period of record (cubic feet per second) Percentiles (1, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50,
    75, 80, 90, 95, 99) of daily flow for the period of record (cubic feet per second)
    Average and standard deviation of daily flow for the period of record (cubic feet
    per second) Mean annual base-flow index (BFI) computed for the period of record
    (fraction, ranging from 0 to 1) Year-to-year standard deviation of the annual
    base-flow index computed for the period of record (fraction) Number of years of
    data used to compute the base-flow index (years) The streamflow data used to compute
    flow characteristics were copied from the NWIS-Web historical daily discharge
    archive (http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/sw) on June 15, 2005.'

  description: 'This raster data set represents water-level change in the High Plains
    aquifer of the United States from 1995 to 2000, in feet. The High Plains aquifer
    underlies 112.6 million acres (176,000 square miles) in parts of eight States:
    Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming.
    The aquifer''s saturated thickness ranges from near zero to about 1,200 feet (Weeks
    and Gutentag, 1981). Water-level declines occurred in parts of the High Plains
    aquifer soon after the onset of substantial irrigation with groundwater (about
    1950) (Luckey and others, 1981; Gutentag and others, 1984). This data set was
    generated in a geographic information system from water-level-change data from
    wells measured in 1995 and 2000 and from some additional wells in New Mexico,
    which were measured in 1996, 1997, 2001, and 2002. For this data set, areas of
    no substantial change were designated as areas where water-level change was between
    a rise of 1 foot and a decline of 1 foot; the raster was set to zero in the areas
    of no substantial change. REFERENCES CITED -- Gutentag, E.D., Heimes, F.J., Krothe,

  description: The U.S. Geological Survey has compiled a map of shale gas assessments
    in the United States that were completed by 2012, such assessments having been
    included as part of the U.S. Geological Survey National Assessment of Oil and
    Gas Project. Using a geology-based assessment methodology, the U.S. Geological
    Survey quantitatively estimated potential volumes of undiscovered gas within shale-gas
    assessment units. These shale-gas assessment units are mapped, and square-mile
    cells are shown to represent proprietary shale-gas wells. The square-mile cells
    include gas-producing wells from shale intervals. In some cases, shale gas formations
    contain gas in deeper parts of a basin and oil at shallower depths (for example,
    the Woodford Shale and the Eagle Ford Shale). Because a discussion of shale oil
    is beyond the scope of this report, only shale gas assessment units and cells
    are shown. The map can be printed as a hardcopy map or downloaded for interactive
    analysis in a Geographic Information System data package using the ArcGIS map
    document (file extension MXD) and published map file (file extension PMF). Also
    available is a publications access table with hyperlinks to current U.S. Geological
    Survey shale gas assessment publications and web pages. Assessment results and
    geologic reports are available as completed at the U.S. Geological Survey Energy
    Resources Program Web Site, http://energy.usgs.gov/OilGas/AssessmentsData/NationalOilGasAssessment.aspx.
    A historical perspective of shale gas activity in the United States is documented
    below and presented in a video clip included as a PowerPoint slideshow.

  description: 'Several bureaus within the Department of Interior compiled available
    information from seabird observation datasets from the Atlantic Outer Continental
    Shelf into a single database, with the goal of conducting research and informing
    coastal and offshore planning activities. The cooperators were the Bureau of Ocean
    Energy Management''s (BOEM) Environmental Studies Program (http://www.boem.gov/Environmental-Stewardship/Environmental-Studies/Environmental-Studies.aspx),
    the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service''s (USFWS) Division of Migratory Bird Management
    (http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/) and the U.S. Geological Survey''s (USGS)
    Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov). The resulting product
    is the Atlantic Offshore Seabird Dataset Catalog, which characterizes the survey
    effort and bird observations that have been collected across space and time. Currently,
    the database contains ~60 datasets from 1906-2009 with over 260,000 records of
    seabird observations. Data will initially be provided as summary web mapping services,
    with web feature services (for downloading and looking at single-species data)
    at the linkage given elsewhere in this document. USAGE: Seabirds provide unique
    challenges even when using estimation techniques to sample populations (e.g.,
    Tasker et al. 1984, Spear et al. 1992). To date, there has been little consistency
    among survey designs. Surveys have varied by the type of vessel from which they
    are conducted (ship, plane), the methodology that counts are made, the width of
    the area being counted, and equipment used, among many other differences. Under
    such circumstances, comparing results and making inferences can be difficult.
    Because these estimates of effort-adjusted counts do not account for detection
    probability, they are likely biased by factors that affect this parameter such
    as weather, survey method, observer, or other environmental variables (MacKenzie
    et al. 2006). Such results may be considered naÃ¯ve in that they do not account
    for factors that can affect the ability to detect an animal. Furthermore, these
    results contain data collected over a 30 year period without regard for any long
    term temporal changes that may have occurred with species or the environment.
    Further analysis is necessary to determine if such changes have occurred with
    any species. While it is possible to separate data collected recently from historical
    (>20 years old) datasets, the amount of recent data is limited and therefore maps
    showing only these data may be limited spatially. Finally, effort calculations
    do not account for survey width, while normally static during a survey, can be
    reduced during certain conditions and does vary by survey method, especially boat
    vs. plan surveys. The vast majority of survey data collected offshore U.S. Atlantic
    waters were collected using similar techniques and so effort data will not be
    greatly affected by such discrepancies. Still, such differences do exist and were
    not accounted for; therefore, this estimate of survey effort is a rough surrogate
    for effort. Consequently, the effort-adjusted counts will also be affected by
    differences in survey methodology and should be considered only roughly offset
    by effort.'

  description: 'The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) was produced by the
    National Renewable Energy Laboratory under the U.S. Department of Energy''s Office
    of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The 1991-2010 NSRDB is an update of
    the 1991-2005 NSRDB released in 2006 and archived at NCDC. The serially complete
    hourly data provided in the NSRDB update are provided in two output formats: 1)
    ground-based solar and meteorological dataset, and 2) 10 km gridded output produced
    by the SUNY model. The 10 km gridded output is from the State University of New
    York/Albany (SUNY) satellite radiation model developed by Richard Perez and Clean
    Power Research. Data in the NSRDB are a slightly modified version of the SolarAnywhere
    dataset distributed by Clear Power Research. The modifications are detailed in
    the NSRDB User''s Manual. The model uses hourly radiance images estimated from
    Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imagery, daily snow cover
    data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount
    of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total irradiance (sun and
    sky) falling on a horizontal surface. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and
    aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. In simple terms, this satellite
    model uses the inverse relationship between reflected irradiance (that reflected
    by clouds and atmosphere back to space and the satellite sensor) and ground irradiance
    (that transmitted through the atmosphere to the Earth''s surface). The high-resolution
    10-km gridded data set from the SUNY model provides a consistency in modeled output
    data for its period of record for the years 1998 to 2009, the period for which
    necessary GOES imagery was available for the project. The SUNY model produces
    estimates of global and direct irradiance at hourly intervals on the 10-km grid
    for 49 states, excluding Alaska, where the geostationary satellites cannot resolve
    cloud cover with necessary detail. Although GOES images provide up to 1-km resolution,
    in the SUNY model, these data are down-sampled to 10-km resolution (0.1 degree
    x 0.1 degree). This resolution is adequate for most solar radiation resource applications
    and represents a practical trade-off between resolution and processing and data
    storage considerations. The model uses both GOES-East and GOES-West satellites
    for complete spatial coverage of the United States.'

  description: According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency US EPA,
    run off from agricultural lands is one of the greatest contributors of pollutants
    to surface waters in this country. Major agricultural pollutants include bacterial
    pathogens and nutrients that originate from animal wastes. Several concentrated
    animal feeding operations CAFOs are located in close proximity to the Salt Plains
    National Wildlife Refuge in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma; it is our understanding
    that these facilities are not US EPA registered. The goal of this study was to
    survey refuge surface water and sediment for known bacterial pathogens of wildlife,
    especially waterfowl, which may have originated from CAFO wastes. Sampling was
    conducted during the spring, summer, and fall of 2001 and 2002 at ten sites located
    on watersheds downstream of agricultural sites. Bacterial indicators of fecal
    contamination fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci were identified and counted
    in surface water samples. Fecal coliform levels exceeded US EPA human recreational
    bathing water limits in 22 of 50 samples, and fecal streptococcus numbers exceeded
    human recreational bathing limits in 47 of 50 samples. Antibiotic resistance profiles
    were determined for a subset of fecal colifom and fecal streptococcus isolates.
    The tested isolates were frequently resistant to ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, and
    tetracycline, antibiotics commonly administered to livestock. In addition, surface
    water and sediment samples were analyzed for the presence of bacteria Clostridium
    botulinum type C, toxigenic Escherichia coli, Erysipelothrix spp., Pasteurella
    multocida, Salmonella spp., and Yersinia spp with pathogenic potential to wild
    and domestic animals. Of the organisms surveyed, salmonellae and escherichiae
    were isolated. The data presented herein will provide a benchmark for future studies
    investigating the potential long term environmental effects of agricultural practices
    on the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge.

    Routes (NTAD 2015) were developed using the 2004 First Edition TIGER/Line files.
    The routes are described in the National Hazardous Material Route Registry (NMHRR).
    The on-line NMHRR linkage is http://hazmat.fmcsa.dot.gov/nhmrr/index.asp With
    the exception of 13 features that were not identified with the Tiger/Lines, Hazmat
    routes were created by extracting the TIGER/Line segments that corresponded to
    each individual route. Hazmat routes in the NTAD, are organized into 3 database
    files, hazmat.shp, hmroutes.dbf, and hmstcnty.dbf. Each record in each database
    represents a unique Tiger/Line segment. These Tiger/Line segments are grouped
    into routes identified as character strings in the ROUTE_ID field in the hmroutes.dbf
    table. The route name appearing in the ROUTE_ID is assigned by FMCSA and is unique
    for each State [this sentence could be deleted - it doesn't add a lot to it].
    The hmstcnty.dbf table allows the user to select routes by State and County. A
    single shapefile, called hazmat.shp, represents geometry for all routes in the
    United States.

  description: 'Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (hereafter, GLDAS-2)
    has two components: one forced entirely with the Princeton meteorological forcing
    data (hereafter, GLDAS-2.0), and the other forced with a combination of model
    and observation based forcing data sets (hereafter, GLDAS-2.1). This data set,
    GLDAS-2.0 0.25 degree monthly generated through temporal averaging of the 3-hourly
    data, contains a series of land surface parameters simulated from the Noah Model
    3.3, currently covers from 1948 to 2010 and will be extended to recent years as
    the data set becomes available. The model simulation was initialized on simulation
    date January 1, 1948, using soil moisture and other state fields from the LSM
    climatology for that day of the year. The simulation was forced by the global
    meteorological forcing data set from Princeton University (Sheffield et al., 2006).
    The simulation used the common GLDAS data sets for land cover (MCD12Q1: Friedl
    et al., 2010), land water mask (MOD44W: Carroll et al., 2009), soil texture (Reynolds,
    1999), and elevation (GTOPO30). The MODIS based land surface parameters are used
    in the current GLDAS-2.x products while the AVHRR base parameters were used in
    GLDAS-1 and previous GLDAS-2 products (prior to October 2012). The main objective
    for Version 2 is to create more climatologically consistent data sets using the
    Princeton forcing data sets extending from 1948. In Version 1, forcing sources
    switched several times throughout the record from 1979 to present, which introduced
    unnatural trends and exhibited highly uncertain forcing fields in 1995-1997. Other
    enhancements made in Version 2 include model version upgrade, switching to MODIS
    based land surface parameter data sets, and initialization of soil moisture over
    desert. In NOAH model, the bottom layer temperature data set was also updated.
    More details regarding the land surface parameter data changes at http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas/.
    WGRIB or other GRIB reader is required to read the files. The data set applies
    a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter numbers.
    The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_GLDAS_V2.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition
    Section (PDS) IDs and units. There are four vertical levels for the Soil Moisture
    (PDS 086) and Soil Temperature (PDS 085) in the Noah GRIB files. For more information,

  description: "Monthly global soil moisture, runoff, and evaporation data sets produced
    by the Leaky Bucket model at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution for the period from 1948 to

    while the driving input fields are Climate Prediction Center monthly global precipitation
    over land, which uses over 17,000 gauges worldwide, and monthly global temperature
    from GHCN-CAMS (Fan and Van den Dool 2008). The output consists of global monthly
    soil moisture, evaporation, and runoff, starting from January 1948. A distinguishing
    feature of this data set is that all fields are updated monthly, which greatly
    enhances utility for near real time purposes. Data validation shows that the land
    model does well; both the simulated annual cycle and interannual variability of
    soil moisture are reasonably good against the limited observations in different
    regions. Refer to these papers: Fan, Y. and H. van den Dool (2004), Climate Prediction

  _identifier: USDA-ERS-00093
  _poc_org: Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture
  description: U.S. consumers demand variety, quality, and convenience in the foods
    they consume. As Americans have become wealthier and more ethnically diverse,
    the American food basket reflects a growing share of tropical products, spices,
    and imported gourmet products. Seasonal and climatic factors drive U.S. imports
    of popular types of fruits and vegetables and tropical products, such as cocoa
    and coffee. In addition, a growing share of U.S. imports can be attributed to
    intra-industry trade, whereby agricultural-processing industries based in the
    United States carry out certain processing steps offshore and import products
    at different levels of processing from their subsidiaries in foreign markets.
    This data set provides import values of edible products (food and beverages) entering
    U.S. ports and their origin of shipment. Data are from the U.S. Department of
    Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau. Food and beverage import values are compiled by
    calendar year into food groups corresponding to major commodities or level of
    processing. At least 10 years of annual data are included, enabling users to track
    long-term growth patterns.

  description: 'The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has generated and mapped isobioclimate
    classes for the contiguous United States. These isobioclimate classes were created
    as part of an effort to map standardized, terrestrial ecosystems for the nation
    using a classification developed by NatureServe (Comer and others, 2003). Ecosystem
    distributions were modeled using a biophysical stratification approach developed
    for South America (Sayre and others, 2008) and now being implemented globally
    (Sayre and others, 2007). Bioclimate regimes strongly influence the differentiation
    and distribution of terrestrial ecosystems, and are one of the key input layers
    in the ecosystem delineation process. The Rivas-MartÃ­nez methodology used to
    produce these classes was developed from a consideration of bioclimatology and
    its relationship to phytogeography (Rivas-MartÃ­nez, 2004; Rivas-MartÃ­nez and
    others, 1999, 2004). This approach develops a number of bioclimatic indices calculated
    from a variety of data on temperature and precipitation (e.g. average temperature
    of the coldest month, total precipitation of the warmest four-month period, a
    continentality index and a thermicity index). Daymet data, which was developed
    from 18-year (1980-1997) climatological records and is available at a spatial
    resolution of 1 kilometer, was used as the source data for these indices (Thornton,
    1997). Once calculated the values of these indices are compared to established
    thresholds for the differentiation of thermotypic (warm/cold gradients) and ombrotypic
    (wet/dry gradients) regions, and the results are used in sets of decision rules
    to identify classes. The classification is implemented in four levels: macrobioclimates,
    bioclimates, thermotypes (thermoclimatic belts) and ombrotypes (ombroclimatic
    belts). The final isobioclimates dataset represents areas of the 127 unique thermotype-ombrotype
    combinations that were mapped for the contiguous United States.'

  description: PARCA began in 1993 with the primary goal of measuring and understanding
    the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Approximately 25 investigations used
    in situ measurements and satellite and aircraft remote sensing to study this issue.
    Measurements include surface elevation and ice thickness change rates from aircraft
    laser altimetry, shallow to intermediate ice cores (for average accumulation rates
    and their temporal and spatial variability), velocity around the ice-sheet perimeter
    at an elevation of about 2000 meters, local ice thickening/thinning rates, and
    climatological observations from automatic weather stations. Satellite data used
    include elevation change from radar altimetry; mapping of snow facies and zones
    of summer melt from passive and active microwave; ice velocities from interferometric
    synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and from repeat high-resolution visible and SAR
    imagery; mapping surface and 10-m temperatures, accumulation rates, and surface
    albedo from microwave and AVHRR data. Data are available either by FTP or through
    investigator Web sites. Questions about investigator data should be directed to
    the individual technical contacts responsible for each data set. The National
    Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) provides summaries and links to these data as
    a service to our users.

  description: 'ABSTRACT: This data set provides the results of time-series analyses
    of Landsat imagery for 55 selected forested sites across the conterminous U.S.A.
    The output is a pair of disturbance data products for each site, one showing the
    first year of disturbance in the time series, the other showing the last year
    of disturbance. Each data pixel is labeled as either a static land class (persistent
    non-forest, persistent forest, or persistent water) or with the year of change
    for disturbed forest pixels. The time period analyzed is approximately 1984-2009.These
    forest disturbance data are distributed as a single band GeoTiff, with appropriate
    projection information defined within the file. The analyses were performed in
    three phases: 5 sites during the Prototype/Focal phase; 23 sites in Phase I; and
    27 sites in Phase II. The spatial resolution of the Prototype/Focal and Phase
    I data is 28.5 meters. The spatial resolution of the Phase II data is 30 meters.
    The temporal resolution is nominally biennial. The mapped area for each forested
    site is approximately 185 km x 185 km. There are a total of 110 GeoTiff files
    - a first year and a last year disturbance file for each of the 55 sites.'

  description: NOAA's National Climatic Data Center is now producing the Regional
    Snowfall Index (RSI) for significant snowstorms that impact the eastern two thirds
    of the U.S. The RSI ranks snowstorm impacts on a scale from 1 to 5, similar to
    the Fujita scale for tornadoes or the Saffir-Simpson scale for hurricanes. NCDC
    has analyzed and assigned RSI values to over 500 storms going as far back as 1900.
    New storms are added operationally. As such, RSI puts the regional impacts of
    snowstorms into a century-scale historical perspective. The RSI differs from other
    indices because it includes population. RSI is based on the spatial extent of
    the storm, the amount of snowfall, and the juxtaposition of these elements with
    population. The area and population are cumulative values above regional specific
    thresholds. For example, the thresholds for the Southeast are 2", 5", 10", and
    15" of snowfall while the thresholds for the Northeast are 4", 10", 20", and 30"
    of snowfall. Population information ties the index to societal impacts. Currently,
    the index uses population based on the 2000 Census. The RSI is an evolution of
    the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS) which NCDC began producing operationally
    in 2005. While NESIS was developed for storms that had a major impact in the Northeast,
    it includes the impact of snow on other regions as well. It can be thought of
    as a quasi-national index that is calibrated to Northeast snowstorms. By contrast,
    the RSI is a regional index; a separate index is produced for each of the six
    NCDC climate regions in the eastern two-thirds of the nation. The indices are
    calculated in a similar fashion to NESIS, but our experience has led us to propose
    a change in the methodology. The new indices require region-specific parameters
    and thresholds for the calculations. For details on how RSI is calculated, see
    Squires et al. 2011.

  description: These estimates are derived from the best available solar resource
    data available to NREL. Resources are organized by class and country. Resolution
    varies spatially from 1 km to 1 degree (approximately 100 km) depending on the
    data source. High spatial resolution datasets (1 km to 40 km cells) were modeled
    to support country or regional projects. Where high resolution datasets were not
    available, data from NASA’s Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) version
    6 database were used. The data represent total potential solar energy per year
    as a function of land area per solar class (`KWh/m²/day`). Each solar class correlates
    to a specific `0.5 kWh/m²/day` range. Energy is calculated by multiplying the
    productive land by the class, conversion efficiency and number of days per year.
    In this case, a standard calendar year of 365 days was used. The conversion efficiency
    rate applied was 10%. `E = Productive Land * kWh/m²/day * 365 days * 10% efficiency`
    The solar data has been derived from solar data measured or modeled between 1961
    and 2008, depending on the dataset.

  description: 'Global Surface Summary of the Day is derived from The Integrated Surface
    Hourly (ISH) dataset. The ISH dataset includes global data obtained from the USAF
    Climatology Center, located in the Federal Climate Complex with NCDC. The latest
    daily summary data are normally available 1-2 days after the date-time of the
    observations used in the daily summaries. The online data files begin with 1929
    and are at the time of this writing at the Version 8 software level. Over 9000
    stations'' data are typically available. The daily elements included in the dataset
    (as available from each station) are: Mean temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Mean dew
    point (.1 Fahrenheit) Mean sea level pressure (.1 mb) Mean station pressure (.1
    mb) Mean visibility (.1 miles) Mean wind speed (.1 knots) Maximum sustained wind
    speed (.1 knots) Maximum wind gust (.1 knots) Maximum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit)
    Minimum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Precipitation amount (.01 inches) Snow depth
    (.1 inches) Indicator for occurrence of: Fog, Rain or Drizzle, Snow or Ice Pellets,
    Hail, Thunder, Tornado/Funnel Cloud Global summary of day data for 18 surface
    meteorological elements are derived from the synoptic/hourly observations contained
    in USAF DATSAV3 Surface data and Federal Climate Complex Integrated Surface Hourly
    (ISH). Historical data are generally available for 1929 to the present, with data
    from 1973 to the present being the most complete. For some periods, one or more
    countries'' data may not be available due to data restrictions or communications
    problems. In deriving the summary of day data, a minimum of 4 observations for
    the day must be present (allows for stations which report 4 synoptic observations/day).
    Since the data are converted to constant units (e.g, knots), slight rounding error
    from the originally reported values may occur (e.g, 9.9 instead of 10.0). The
    mean daily values described below are based on the hours of operation for the
    station. For some stations/countries, the visibility will sometimes ''cluster''
    around a value (such as 10 miles) due to the practice of not reporting visibilities
    greater than certain distances. The daily extremes and totals--maximum wind gust,
    precipitation amount, and snow depth--will only appear if the station reports
    the data sufficiently to provide a valid value. Therefore, these three elements
    will appear less frequently than other values. Also, these elements are derived
    from the stations'' reports during the day, and may comprise a 24-hour period
    which includes a portion of the previous day. The data are reported and summarized
    based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT, 0000Z - 2359Z) since the original synoptic/hourly
    data are reported and based on GMT.'

  description: The NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) produces national
    standardized land cover and change products for the coastal regions of the U.S.
    C-CAP products inventory coastal intertidal areas, wetlands, and adjacent uplands
    with the goal of monitoring changes in these habitats, on a one-to-five year repeat
    cycle. The timeframe for this metadata is reported as 1985 - 2010-Era, but the
    actual dates of the Landsat imagery used to create the land cover may have been
    acquired a few years before or after each era. These maps are developed utilizing
    Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, and can be used to track changes in the landscape
    through time. This trend information gives important feedback to managers on the
    success or failure of management policies and programs and aid in developing a
    scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced
    changes. This understanding allows for the prediction of impacts due to these
    changes and the assessment of their cumulative effects, helping coastal resource
    managers make more informed regional decisions. NOAA C-CAP is a contributing member
    to the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics consortium and C-CAP products are
    included as the coastal expression of land cover within the National Land Cover
    Database.

    TMP2m, UGRD10m, and VGRD10m, are the monthly average from 00Z01 of month to 23:59Zlastdayofmonth.
    The variables, BRTMPsfc and CAPEsfc, are the monthly average from 00Z01 of month
    to 23:59Zlastdayofmonth, except if any hour has an undefined value of -9999, then
    do not include the hour in the monthly average. The variables, PARsfc and RGOESsfc,
    are the monthly average from 00Z01 of month to 23:59Zlastdayofmonth, except if
    any hour has an undefined value of -9999, then reassign the variable as zero and
    include the hour in the monthly average. The variables, ACPCPsfc, APCPsfc, PEDASsfc,
    and PRDARsfc, are the monthly accumulation from 00Z01 of month to 23:59Zlastdayofmonth.
    However, the ACPCPsfc is actually the sum of the (ACPCPsfc/PEDASsfc)*APCPsfc from
    each hour, where the ratio of (ACPCPsfc/PEDASsfc) is the fraction of convective
    precipitation from EDAS, and then multiplied by the APCPsfc to get the convective
    precipitation. For PRDARsfc accumulation, if hourly PRDARsfc is undefined or negative,
    fill the hour with a zero value. The last variable, RSWRFsfc, is the monthly average
    from 00Z01 of month to 23:59Zlastdayofmonth, except represents the monthly average
    of the hourly "blend" of the DSWRFsfc from EDAS and RGOESsfc from GEOS. The blend
    algorithm is that, for each hour, the RGOESsfc from GEOS is used for all the grid
    points where it is available, but for where it is not available, the DSWRFsfc
    from EDAS is used. Because the spatial extent/availability of GEOS varies from
    hour to hour, this blend is done for hourly data first, and then the monthly average
    is applied to the hourly blended data. This last variable thus best represents
    the shortwave radiation flux downwards at the surface that is used in the NLDAS-1
    LSMs. More about this blending/supplementation can be found from http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/nldas/NLDAS1forcing.php.

  description: This dataset consists of a polyline depicting the coast and coastal
    features of the western Arctic Coastal Plain as derived from a mosaic created
    from an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR) derived digital surface
    model acquired over the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPRA) in northern Alaska
    between 2002 and 2006. The primary IFSAR dataset was acquired by Intermap Technologies
    and contracted by the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Geological Survey, and the
    National Science Foundation. The raw data were collected with a STAR-3i airborne
    synthetic aperture radar system, a high-resolution, single pass, across track
    IfSAR system (Intermap, 2010). The Digital Surface Model (DSM) products represent
    the first reflective surface as illuminated by the radar. The STAR-3i system is
    capable of acquiring imagery with a horizontal accuracy better than 2 m, a vertical
    accuracy better than 1 m, and a vertical resolution on the order of 0.1 m (Intermap,
    2010). Accuracy statements are based on areas of moderate terrain. Diminished
    accuracies are to be expected in areas of extreme terrain and dense vegetation.
    In addition, the DSM contains processing artifacts expressing as 30 to 50 cm high
    ripples or 'corn rows' that should be considered causing additional vertical error
    in the dataset. This striping results from uncompensated differential phase errors
    on very flat terrain.

  description: The 2014 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations
    of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File
    / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database
    (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic
    mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain
    the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment
    of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align
    with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based
    files while others are available only as state-based files. Alaska Native Regional
    Corporations (ANRCs) were created pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement
    Act (ANCSA), which is federal legislation (Pub. L. 92-203, 85 Stat. 688 (1971);
    43 U.S.C. 1602 et seq. (2000)) enacted in 1971, as a "Regional Corporation" and
    organized under the laws of the State of Alaska to conduct both the for-profit
    and non-profit affairs of Alaska Natives within a defined region of Alaska. For
    the Census Bureau, ANRCs are considered legal geographic entities. Twelve ANRCs
    cover the entire state of Alaska except for the area within the Annette Island
    Reserve (a federally recognized American Indian reservation under the governmental
    authority of the Metlakatla Indian Community). A thirteenth ANRC represents Alaska
    Natives who do not live in Alaska and do not identify with any of the twelve corporations.
    The Census Bureau does not provide data for this thirteenth ANRC because it has
    no defined geographic extent and thus it does not appear in the Cartographic Boundary
    Files. The Census Bureau offers representatives of the twelve non-profit ANRCs
    in Alaska the opportunity to review and update the ANRC boundaries before each
    decennial census.

  description: The Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) is a weather forecast model
    made up of 21 separate forecasts, or ensemble members. The National Centers for
    Environmental Prediction (NCEP) started the GEFS to address the nature of uncertainty
    in weather observations, which are used to initialize weather forecast models.
    The proverbial butterfly flapping her wings can have a cascading effect leading
    to wind gusts thousands of miles away. This extreme example illustrates that tiny,
    unnoticeable differences between reality and what is actually measured can, over
    time, lead to noticeable differences between what a weather model forecast predicts
    and reality itself. The GEFS attempts to quantify the amount of uncertainty in
    a forecast by generating an ensemble of multiple forecasts, each minutely different,
    or perturbed, from the original observations. With global coverage, GEFS is produced
    four times a day with weather forecasts going out to 16 days and a 6 hour temporal
    resolution. This dataset has 2.5 degree horizontal resolution.

  description: 'This shapefile represents seasonal summer average net power estimates.
    The OTEC Plant model predicts the net power production at a specific location,
    given three inputs: surface temperature (°C), depth (m), and difference between
    warm surface water temperature and cold deep sea water temperature (ΔT in °C)
    at the given depth, relative to the surface temperature. In order to normalize
    values for the purposes of visualization of the OTEC resource around the world,
    a baseline plant design was used. The baseline 100MW Net Power design has been
    optimized for conditions indicative of the Hawai‘i OTEC resource. As such, power
    output as described by the results of this study is not optimized for local conditions
    (except in parts of Hawai’i), but does provide guidance for site selection. Given
    the nominal plant power output of 100MW based on a competitive cost of electricity
    (Hawai’i), any output exceeding this value represents significant potential. A
    large area of predicted 100 MW+ net power exists in many locations around the
    world, especially in areas with high energy costs. Data were processed and converted
    to shapefile format by NREL for the [Ocean Thermal Extractable Energy Visualization](http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/1055457/1055457.pdf)

    Commission for Environmental Co-operation, has led to the release (June 2004)

    from each of the partner countries both for visualization and download. The North
    American Atlas data are standardized geospatial data sets at 1:10,000,000 scale.
    A variety of basic data layers (e.g. roads, railroads, populated places, political
    boundaries, hydrography, bathymetry, sea ice and glaciers) have been integrated
    so that their relative positions are correct. This collection of data sets forms
    a base with which other North American thematic data may be integrated. Any data
    outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America included in the North
    American Atlas data sets is strictly to complete the context of the data. The
    North American Atlas - Glaciers data set shows areas of permanent ice found on
    the North America landmass including Greenland, and also shows areas of land found
    within glaciers. No distinction is made between major glaciers, ice fields, and
    the Greenland ice cap. The only permanent ice shown on land areas outside of North
    America and Greenland is on Iceland.'

  description: 'Actual ET (ETa) is produced using the operational Simplified Surface

    approach (Senay and others, 2007, 2011) with unique parameterization for operational
    applications. It combines ET fractions generated from remotely sensed MODIS thermal
    imagery, acquired every 8 days, with reference ET using a thermal index approach.
    The unique feature of the SSEBop parameterization is that it uses pre-defined,
    seasonally dynamic, boundary conditions that are unique to each pixel for the
    hot/dry and cold/wet reference points. Reference: Senay, G. B., Bohms, S., Singh,

    The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area,
    such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage
    areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can further be
    subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different
    levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The
    WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined
    by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds. For
    additional information on the WBD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html. The USGS
    National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) service is a companion dataset to the WBD.
    The NHD is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information
    about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds,
    and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and
    rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages,
    and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification
    and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related
    measures, a "reach code" through which other information can be related to the
    NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water
    and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream
    directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata
    that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The
    NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale
    maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale
    maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the
    United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater,
    and referred to as local resolution NHD. For more information on the NHD, go to
    http://nhd.usgs.gov/index.html. Hydrography data from The National Map supports
    many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling,
    data maintenance, and stewardship. Hydrography data is commonly combined with
    other data themes, such as boundaries, elevation, structures, and transportation,
    to produce general reference base maps. The National Map viewer allows free downloads
    of public domain WBD and NHD data in either Esri File or Personal Geodatabase,
    or Shapefile formats.

  description: This data set represents the area of each level 3 nutrient ecoregion
    in square meters, compiled for every catchment of NHDPlus for the conterminous
    United States. The source data are from the 2002 version of the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency's (USEPA) Aggregations of Level III Ecoregions for National
    Nutrient Assessment & Management Strategy (USEPA, 2002). The NHDPlus Version 1.1
    is an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial datasets that incorporates
    many of the best features of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National
    Elevation Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,00-scale
    NHD), improved networking, naming, and value-added attributes (VAAs). NHDPlus
    also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage
    enforcement technique first widely used in New England, and thus referred to as
    "the New England Method." This technique involves "burning in" the 1:100,000-scale
    NHD and when available building "walls" using the National Watershed Boundary
    Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital elevation model (HydroDEM) is used
    to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHD and WBD. Over the past
    two years, an interdisciplinary team from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and
    the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and contractors, found that
    this method produces the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process
    (USEPA, 2007). The NHDPlus dataset is organized by 18 Production Units that cover
    the conterminous United States. The NHDPlus version 1.1 data are grouped by the
    U.S. Geologic Survey's Major River Basins (MRBs, Crawford and others, 2006). MRB1,
    covering the New England and Mid-Atlantic River basins, contains NHDPlus Production
    Units 1 and 2. MRB2, covering the South Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins,
    contains NHDPlus Production Units 3 and 6. MRB3, covering the Great Lakes, Ohio,
    Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy River basins, contains NHDPlus Production
    Units 4, 5, 7 and 9. MRB4, covering the Missouri River basins, contains NHDPlus
    Production Units 10-lower and 10-upper. MRB5, covering the Lower Mississippi,
    Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units
    8, 11 and 12. MRB6, covering the Rio Grande, Colorado and Great Basin River basins,
    contains NHDPlus Production Units 13, 14, 15 and 16. MRB7, covering the Pacific
    Northwest River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Unit 17. MRB8, covering California
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Unit 18.

  description: This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated
    from the Noah land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North American Land
    Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing
    and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is monthly. The
    file format is WMO GRIB-1. The NLDAS-2 monthly Noah model data were generated
    from the NLDAS-2 hourly Noah model data, as monthly accumulation for rainfall,
    snowfall, subsurface runoff, surface runoff, total evapotranspiration, and snow
    melt, and monthly average for other variables. Monthly period of each month is
    from 00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z at end of the month, except the first
    month (Jan 1979) that starts from 00Z 02 Jan 1979. Also for the first month (Jan
    1979), because the variables listed as instantaneous in the README file (http://hydro1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/s4pa/NLDAS/README.NLDAS2.pdf)
    do not have valid data exactly on 00Z 02 Jan 1979, and this one hour is not included
    in the average for this month only. Brief description about the NLDAS-2 monthly
    Noah model can be found from the GCMD DIF for GES_DISC_NLDAS_NOAH0125_H_V002 at
    http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_NOAH0125_H_V002. Details about
    the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Noah LSM can be found in Xia et al. (2012). The
    NLDAS-2 Noah monthly data contain fifty-two fields. The data set applies a user-defined
    parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter number. The GRIBTAB file
    (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_NOAH.002.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition

  description: This high-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) analysis product
    was developed using an optimum interpolation (OI) technique. The SST analysis
    has a spatial grid resolution of 0.25 degree and temporal resolution of 1 day.
    The product uses Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data
    from the Pathfinder AVHRR SST dataset when available for September 1981 through
    December 2005, and the operational Navy AVHRR SST data for 2006 to the present
    day. Pathfinder AVHRR SST was chosen because of good agreement with the in situ
    observation data. The product also uses sea ice datasets, in situ data from ships
    and buoys, and includes a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect
    to the in situ data. In areas where sea ice is present, SST is estimated from
    sea ice concentration datasets from NASA GSFC before 2005 and then from NOAA NCEP
    from 2005 onwards. Preliminary products are produced daily in near real-time (1-day
    latency) and may be updated in the first few days if critical input data become
    available after the initial production time. After two weeks, a complete or final
    product is generated with no additional changes expected. The preliminary products
    from near real-time data productions began in October 2008 for Version 2.0. The
    product is in netCDF-3 following the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions, and
    is accompanied by algorithm documentation, data flow diagram and source code under
    the NOAA CDR Program.

  description: 'ABSTRACT: This data set provides forest age map products at 1-km resolution
    for Canada and the United States (U.S.A.). These continental forest age maps were
    compiled from forest inventory data, historical fire data, optical satellite data,
    and the images from the NASA Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing
    System (LEDAPS) project. These input data products have various sources and creation
    dates as described in the source paper by Pan et al. (2011). Canadian maps were
    produced with data available through 2004 and U.S.A. maps with data available
    through 2006. A supplementary map of the standard deviations for age estimates
    was developed for quantifying uncertainty.Note that the Pan et al. (2011) paper
    is included as a companion file with this data set and was the source of descriptions
    in the guide.Forest age, implicitly reflecting the past disturbance legacy, is
    a simple and direct surrogate for the time since disturbance and may be used in
    various forest carbon analyses that concern the impact of disturbances. By combining
    geographic information about forest age with estimated carbon dynamics by forest
    type, it is possible to conduct a simple but powerful analysis of the net CO2
    uptake by forests, and the potential for increasing (or decreasing) this rate
    as a result of direct human intervention in the disturbance/age status.'

  description: The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a weather forecast model produced
    by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Dozens of atmospheric
    and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures,
    winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration.
    The entire globe is covered by the GFS at a base horizontal resolution of 18 miles
    (28 kilometers) between grid points, which is used by the operational forecasters
    who predict weather out to 16 days in the future. Horizontal resolution drops
    to 44 miles (70 kilometers) between grid point for forecasts between one week
    and two weeks. The GFS model is a coupled model, composed of four separate models
    (an atmosphere model, an ocean model, a land/soil model, and a sea ice model),
    which work together to provide an accurate picture of weather conditions. Changes
    are regularly made to the GFS model to improve its performance and forecast accuracy.
    This dataset is run four times daily at 00z, 06z, 12z and 18z out to 384 hours
    in two parts. The forecast steps out to 192 hours have a 1.0 degree horizontal
    resolution and a 3 hour temporal resolution. Forecast steps from 192 to 384 hours
    have a 2.5 degree horizontal resolution and a 12 hour temporal resolution.

  description: This monthly climatology data set contains a series of land surface
    parameters simulated from the Noah land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the
    North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th
    degree grid spacing. The temporal resolution is monthly, ranging from January
    to December. The NLDAS-2 monthly climatology data are the monthly data averaged
    over the thirty years (1980 - 2009) of the NLDAS-2 monthly data. The file format
    is WMO GRIB-1. Brief description about the NLDAS-2 hourly and monthly Noah LSM
    data can be found from the GCMD DIFs for GES_DISC_NLDAS_NOAH0125_H_V002 and GES_DISC_NLDAS_NOAH0125_M_V002
    at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_NOAH0125_H_V002 and http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_NOAH0125_M_V002.
    Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Noah LSM can be found in Xia et
    al. (2012). The NLDAS-2 Noah monthly climatology data contain fifty-two fields.
    The data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and
    parameter number. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_NOAH.002.txt)
    shows a list of parameters for this data set, along with their Product Definition
    Section (PDS) IDs and units. There are four vertical levels for the Soil Moisture
    Content (PDS 086) and Soil Temperature (PDS 085) in the Noah GRIB files. For more
    information, please see the README Document at ftp://hydro1.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/s4pa/NLDAS/README.NLDAS2.pdf

  description: 'This dataset replaces the previous Time Bias Corrected Divisional
    Temperature-Precipitation Drought Index. The new divisional data set (nCLIMDIV)
    is based on the Global Historical Climatological Network-Daily (GHCN-D) and makes
    use of several improvements to the previous data set. For the input data, improvements
    include additional station networks, quality assurance reviews and temperature
    bias adjustments. Perhaps the most extensive improvement is to the computational
    approach, which now employs climatologically aided interpolation. This 5km grid
    based calculation nCLIMGRID helps to address topographic and network variability.
    This data set is primarily used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA) National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) to issue State of the Climate Reports
    on a monthly basis. These reports summarize recent temperature and precipitation
    conditions and long-term trends at a variety of spatial scales, the smallest being
    the climate division level. Data at the climate division level are aggregated
    to compute statewide, regional and national snapshots of climate conditions. For
    CONUS, the period of record is from 1895-present. Derived quantities such as Standardized
    precipitation Index (SPI), Palmer Drought Indices (PDSI, PHDI, PMDI, and ZNDX)
    and degree days are also available for the CONUS sites. In March 2015, data for
    thirteen Alaskan climate divisions were added to the nCLIMDIV data set. Data for
    the new Alaskan climate divisions begin in 1925 through the present and are included
    in all nCLIMDIV monthly updates. Alaskan climate data include the following elements
    for divisional and statewide coverage: average temperature, maximum temperature
    (highs), minimum temperature (lows), and precipitation. The Alaska nCLIMDIV data
    were created and updated using similar methodology as that for the CONUS, but
    with a different approach to establishing the underlying climatology. The Alaska
    data are built upon the 1971-2000 PRISM averages whereas the CONUS values utilize
    a base climatology derived from the nCLIMGRID data set.'

  description: This data set contains the monthly primary forcing data "File A" for
    Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data
    are in 1/8th degree grid spacing and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal
    resolution is monthly. The file format is WMO GRIB-1. The NLDAS-2 monthly primary
    forcing data were generated from the NLDAS-2 hourly primary forcing data, as monthly
    accumulation for total precipitation, convective precipitation, and potential
    evaporation, and monthly average for other variables. The convective precipitation
    monthly total is the hourly convective fraction multiplied by the hourly precipitation
    (both from the NLDAS-2 "File A" files), and then summed over all hours of the
    month. Monthly period of each month is from 00Z at start of the month to 23:59Z
    at end of the month. The one exception to this is the first month (Jan. 1979)
    that starts from 00Z 02 Jan 1979, except for the monthly accumulated precipitation
    and convective precipitation that both start from 12Z 01 Jan 1979. Brief description
    about the NLDAS-2 hourly primary forcing data can be found from the GCMD DIF for
    GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORA0125_H_V002 at http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/getdif.htm?GES_DISC_NLDAS_FORA0125_H_V002.
    Details about the generation of the NLDAS-2 forcing datasets can be found in Xia
    et al. (2012). The monthly land surface forcing fields for NLDAS-2 are grouped
    into two GRIB files, "File A" and "File B". "File A" is the primary (default)
    forcing file and contains eleven fields. The GRIBTAB file (http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydrology/grib_tabs/gribtab_NLDAS_FORA_monthly.002.txt)

  description: This EnviroAtlas dataset contains data on the mean biological nitrogen
    fixation in natural/semi-natural ecosystems per 12-digit Hydrologic Unit (HUC)
    in 2006. Biological N fixation (BNF) in natural/semi-natural ecosystems was estimated
    using a correlation with actual evapotranspiration (AET). This correlation is
    based on a global meta-analysis of BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems (Cleveland
    et al. 1999). AET estimates for 2006 were calculated using a regression equation
    describing the correlation of AET with climate (average annual daily temperature,
    average annual minimum daily temperature, average annual maximum daily temperature,
    and annual precipitation) and land use/land cover variables in the conterminous
    US (Sanford and Selnick 2013). Data describing annual average minimum and maximum
    daily temperatures and total precipitation for 2006 were acquired from the PRISM
    climate dataset (http://prism.oregonstate.edu). Average annual climate data were
    then calculated for individual 12-digit USGS Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC12s; http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html;
    22 March 2011 release) using the Zonal Statistics tool in ArcMap 10.0. AET for
    individual HUC12s was estimated using equations described in Sanford and Selnick
    (2013). BNF in natural/semi-natural ecosystems within individual HUC12s was modeled
    with an equation describing the statistical relationship between BNF (kg N ha-1
    yr-1) and actual evapotranspiration (AET; cm yr-1) and scaled to the proportion
    of non-developed and non-agricultural land in the HUC12. The first half of the
    equation represents the most conservative estimate in a meta-analysis of BNF in
    natural/semi-natural ecosystems (Cleveland et al. 1999), and was chosen over the
    central and high estimates because recent, top-down global mass balances that
    suggest that natural BNF rates are less than previous estimates based on scaled-up
    estimates from individual plots (Vitousek et al. 2013). The land use/land cover
    modifier is not included in the original Cleveland et al. (1999) analysis. We
    believe it is appropriate to include so as not to overestimate BNF in HUC12s with
    large proportions of urban or agricultural development. These data represent an
    average N input to individual HUC12s, i.e., they are not specific to an individual
    land use type within the HUC12. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support
    research and online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas)
    allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application
    to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.
    The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas)
    or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each
    attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet

  description: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has generated land surface form classes
    for the contiguous United States. These land surface form classes were created
    as part of an effort to map standardized, terrestrial ecosystems for the nation
    using a classification developed by NatureServe (Comer and others, 2003). Ecosystem
    distributions were modeled using a biophysical stratification approach developed
    for South America (Sayre and others, 2008) and now being implemented globally
    (Sayre and others, 2007). Land surface forms strongly influence the differentiation
    and distribution of terrestrial ecosystems, and are one of the key input layers
    in the ecosystem delineation process. The methodology used to produce these land
    surface form classes was developed by the Missouri Resource Assessment Partnership
    (MoRAP). MoRAP made modifications to Hammond's (1964a, 1964b) land surface form
    classification, which allowed the use of 30-meter source data and a 1 km2 window
    for neighborhood analysis (True 2002, True and others, 2000). While Hammond's
    methodology was based on three variables, slope, local relief, and profile type,
    MoRAP's methodology uses only slope and local relief (True 2002). Slope is classified
    as gently sloping or not gently sloping using a slope threshold of 8%, local relief
    is classified into five classes (0-15m, 15-30m, 30-90m, 90-150m, and >150m), and
    eight landform classes (flat plains, smooth plains, irregular plains, escarpments,
    low hills, hills, breaks, and low mountains) were derived by combining slope class
    and local relief. The USGS implementation of the MoRAP methodology was executed
    using the USGS 30-meter National Elevation Dataset (NED) and an existing USGS
    slope dataset. In this implementation, a new land surface form class, the high
    mountains/deep canyons class, was identified by using an additional local relief
    class (> 400m). The drainage channels class was derived independently from the
    other land surface form classes. This class was derived using two of Andrew Weiss's
    slope position classes, "valley" and "lower slope" (Weiss 2001, Jenness 2006).
    The USGS implemented Weiss's algorithm using the 30-meter NED and a 1 km2 neighborhood
    analysis window. The resultant drainage channel class was combined into the final
    land surface forms dataset.

  description: 'ABSTRACT: The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture and Agri-Food
    Canada, the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the University of Copenhagen
    Institute of Geography, the European Soil Bureau, the University of Manchester
    Institute of Landscape Ecology, MTT Agrifood Research Finland, and the Agricultural
    Research Institute Iceland have shared data and expertise in order to develop
    the Northern and Mid Latitude Soil Database (Cryosol Working Group, 2001). This
    database was the source of data for the current product. The spatial coverage
    of the Northern and Mid Latitude Soil Database is the polar and mid-latitude regions
    of the northern hemisphere: Alaska, Canada, Conterminous United States, Eurasia
    (except Italy), Greenland, Iceland, Kazakstan, Mexico, Mongolia, Italy, and Svalbard.
    The Northern and Mid-Latitude Soil Database represents the proportion (percentage)
    of polygon encompassed by the dominant soil or nonsoil. Soils include turbels,
    orthels, histels, histosols, mollisols, vertisols, aridisols, andisols, entisols,
    spodosols, inceptisols (and hapludolls), alfisols (cryalf and udalf), natric great
    groups, aqu-suborders, glaciers, and rocklands. Also included are data on the
    circumpolar distribution of gelisols (turbels, orthels, and histels), and the
    ice content (low, medium, or high) of circumpolar soil materials (from the International
    Permafrost Association, 1997). The resulting maps show the dominant soil of the
    spatial polygon unless the polygon is over 90 percent rock or ice. Data are in
    the U.S. soil classification system and includes the distribution of soil types
    (%) within a map unit (polygon). Data are available in ESRI shapefile format and
    ESRI interchange file format and include the same attribute values with the exception
    of Italy, which does not contain distribution values.'

  description: 'MarineCadastre.gov is a marine information system that provides authoritative
    ocean data, offshore planning tools, and technical support to the offshore renewable
    energy community. The project was initiated by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L.
    109-58) - Sec. 388 - Alternative Energy-Related Uses on the Outer Continental
    Shelf, which directs the secretary of the interior, in cooperation with the secretary
    of commerce, the commandant of the Coast Guard, and the secretary of defense,
    to establish an outer continental shelf (OCS) mapping initiative to assist in
    decision-making related to alternative energy uses on the OCS. At its core, MarineCadastre.gov
    contains marine cadastral data, which encompass the spatial extent, usage, rights,
    restrictions, and responsibilities of marine areas, as well as other regionally
    specific data needed to support planning, management, and conservation of submerged
    lands and marine spaces. The combination of marine cadastral and regionally specific
    data provides users with many of the data layers needed for renewable energy siting
    and other ocean planning efforts. The MarineCadastre.gov National Viewer is intended
    to be used as a planning and screening tool to inform decisions on ocean uses.
    It is not intended to be used for precise site selection, but rather to provide
    the geospatial picture of ocean planning data layers needed to make decisions
    about where suitable areas exist for offshore activities. MarineCadastre.gov also
    has more regionally focused viewers within its Map Gallery. Those viewers demonstrate
    how marine cadastre data can be used along with state or regionally applicable
    data sets to inform ocean planning decisions.The MarineCadastre.gov Data Registry
    lists all the data layers that can be found on MarineCadastre.gov with the ability
    to shop for layers, add these to a cart, and open in a map on ArcGIS Online. There
    are quarterly updates to the National Viewer and Data Registry. Please sign up

  description: 'ABSTRACT: The data set provides a 30-m comprehensive fuelbed characteristics
    map for both the wildland and cropland areas of the conterminous United States
    (CONUS) for 2010. This integrated product is the result of combining the spatially
    discrete Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) data of the US Forest
    Service (USFS) with the crop-and grassland-specific information of the US Department
    of Agricultures (USDA''s) Cropland Data Layer (CDL). By combining the spatially
    discrete details of the FCCS data set with the crop-and grassland-specific information
    of the CDL, a more robust map of fuelbed characteristics is available. The merged
    product has an advantage over the original FCCS map for estimating emissions from
    burned areas due to the integration of the fuelbed characteristics for agricultural
    areas from the CDL.There are three GeoTIFF format files and three comma-separated
    companion files distributed with this data set. The three tif files provided are
    very large and exceed the size limits of a standard GeoTIFF file format (4 GB).
    File sizes range from 20 to 30 GB. Compressed file sizes range from 2 to 3 GB.
    They are in a format that is called a BigTIFF file. ArcGIS 10.0 and ERDAS Imagine
    are able to read these files.'

  _poc_org: National Aeronautics and Space Administration
  description: 'This data set is generated from brightness temperature data derived
    from the following sensors: the Nimbus-7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer
    (SMMR), the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) -F8, -F11 and -F13
    Special Sensor Microwave/Imagers (SSM/Is), and the DMSP-F17 Special Sensor Microwave
    Imager/Sounder (SSMIS). The data are provided in the polar stereographic projection
    at a grid cell size of 25 x 25 km. This product is designed to provide a consistent
    time series of sea ice concentrations (the fraction, or percentage, of ocean area
    covered by sea ice) spanning the coverage of several passive microwave instruments.
    To aid in this goal, sea ice algorithm coefficients are changed to reduce differences
    in sea ice extent and area as estimated using the SMMR and SSM/I sensors. The
    data are generated using the NASA Team algorithm developed by the Oceans and Ice
    Branch, Laboratory for Hydrospheric Processes at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
    (GSFC). These data include gridded daily (every other day for SMMR data) and monthly
    averaged sea ice concentrations for both the north and south polar regions. The
    data are produced at GSFC about once per year, with roughly a one-year latency,
    and include data since 26 October 1978. Data are produced from SMMR brightness
    temperature data processed at NASA GSFC and from SSM/I and SSMIS brightness temperature
    data processed at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Data are scaled
    and stored as one-byte integers in flat binary arrays. For each data file, a corresponding
    PNG browse image file is provided. Data are available via FTP.'

  description: 'Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS and MISR Aerosol Optical Depth
    (AOD) data sets represent a series of annual average grids (2001-2010) of fine
    particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from
    MODIS and MISR AOD satellite data. Together the grids provide a continuous surface
    of concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers
    or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. The satellite AOD retrievals
    were converted to ground-level concentrations based on a conversion factor developed
    by researchers at Dalhousie University that accounts for spatial and temporal
    variations in aerosol properties and vertical structure as derived from a global
    3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The raster grids have a grid cell resolution
    of 30 arc-minutes (0.5 degree or approximately 50 sq. km at the equator) and cover
    the world from 70°N to 60°S latitude. The grids were produced by researchers at
    Battelle Memorial Institute in collaboration with the Center for International
    Earth Science Information Network/Columbia University under a NASA-ROSES project
    entitled "Using Satellite Data to Develop Environmental Indicators: An Application
    of NASA Data Products to Support High Level Decisions for National and International
    Environmental Protection". Exposure to fine particles is associated with premature
    death as well as increased morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular disease,
    especially in the elderly, young children, and those already suffering from these
    illnesses. The World Health Organization guideline for PM2.5 average annual exposure
    is less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms per cubic meter, whereas the US Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA) primary standard is less than or equal to 12.0 micrograms
    per cubic meter. The EPA primary standards are designed to protect public health
    with an adequate margin of safety. (Suggested Usage: To provide a continuous surface
    of concentrations (micrograms per cubic meter) of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers
    or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research.)'

  description: This data product depicts the locations of facilities that generate
    electricity. Only facilities adjacent to the coast and Great Lakes are identified.
    Contained within the database are records that define the fuel source and other
    characteristics of the facility that may benefit ocean planners. In some cases,
    the presence of a facility may indicate that certain power transmission infrastructure
    exists nearby. Absence of a facility or lack of sufficient capacity at a facility
    in a given area may also be an important characteristic in future energy planning
    activities.

  description: 'ESI data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife
    based on sensitivity to spilled oil. There are three main components: shoreline
    habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources. The shoreline
    and intertidal areas are ranked based on sensitivity determined by: (1) Shoreline
    type (substrate, grain size, tidal elevation, origin); (2) Exposure to wave and
    tidal energy; (3) Biological productivity and sensitivity; and (4) Ease of cleanup.
    The biology layers focus on threatened/endangered species, areas of high concentration,
    and areas where sensitive life stages may occur. Supporting data tables provide
    species-/location-specific abundance, seasonality, status, life history, and source
    information. Human-use resources mapped include managed areas (parks, refuges,
    critical habitats, etc.) and resources that may be impacted by oiling and/or cleanup
    (beaches, archaeological sites, marinas, etc.). ESIs are available for the majority
    of the US coastline, as well as the US territories. ESI data are available in
    a variety of GIS formats, as well as PDF maps. For more information or to download
    complete ESI data sets, go to: http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/esi.'

  description: 'The critical facilities data came from FEMA''s HAZUS database and
    represent available information circa 2011. A critical facility is defined as
    a structure that, if flooded, would present an immediate threat to life, public
    health, and safety. The data may not be exhaustive, more thorough data exist both
    nationally and at the local level. HAZUS breaks critical facilities into two (2)
    groups: essential facilities and high potential loss (HPL) facilities. Essential
    facilities include hospitals, medical clinics, schools, fire stations, police
    stations and emergency operations facilities. High potential loss facilities include
    dams, levees, military installations, nuclear power plants and hazardous material
    sites. Within HAZUS, the lifeline inventory is divided between transportation
    and utility lifeline systems. There are seven (7) transportation systems that
    include highways, railways, light rail, bus, ports, ferry and airports. There
    are six (6) utility systems that include potable water, wastewater, natural gas,
    crude refined oil, electric power and communications. For a full listing of the

  description: 'This data set contains a series of land surface parameters simulated
    from the Mosaic land-surface model (LSM) for Phase 2 of the North American Land
    Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing
    and range from Jan 1979 to the present. The temporal resolution is hourly. The
    file format is WMO GRIB-1. Details about the NLDAS-2 configuration of the Mosaic
    LSM can be found in Xia et al. (2012). Mosaic was developed by Koster and Suarez
    (1994, 1996) to account for subgrid vegetation variability with a tile approach.
    Each vegetation tile carries its own energy and water balance and soil moisture
    and temperature. Each tile has three soil layers, with the first two in the root
    zone. In NLDAS, Mosaic is configured to support a maximum of 10 tiles per grid
    cell with a 5% cutoff that ignores vegetation classes covering less than 5% of
    the cell. Additionally in NLDAS, all tiles of Mosaic in a grid cell have a predominant
    soil type and three soil layers with fixed thickness values of 10, 30, and 160
    cm (hence constant rooting depth of 40 cm and constant total column depth of 200
    cm). The Mosaic LSM was forced by the hourly NLDAS-2 forcing &quot;File A&quot;

  description: 'NREL''s Geographic Information System (GIS) team offers both a national
    wind resource assessment of the United States and high-resolution wind data. The
    national wind resource assessment was created for the U.S. Department of Energy
    in 1986 by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory and is documented in the Wind Energy
    Resource Atlas of the United States, October 1986. This national wind resource
    data provides an estimate of the annual average wind resource for the conterminous
    United States, with a resolution of 1 3 degree of latitude by 1 4 degree of longitude.
    The wind resource assessment was based on surface wind data, coastal marine area
    data, and upper-air data, where applicable. In data-sparse areas, three qualitative
    indicators of wind speed or power were used when applicable: topographic meteorological
    indicators (e.g. gorges, mountain summits, sheltered valleys); wind deformed vegetation;
    and eolian landforms (e.g. playas, sand dunes). The data was evaluated at a regional
    level to produce 12 regional wind resource assessments; the regional assessments
    were then incorporated into the national wind resource assessment. The conterminous
    United States was divided into grid cells 1 4 degree of latitude by 1 3 degree
    of longitude. Each grid cell was assigned a wind power class ranging from 1 to
    6, with 6 being the windiest. The wind power density limits for each wind power
    class are shown in Table 1-1. Each grid cell contains sites of varying power class.
    The assigned wind power class is representative of the range of wind power densities
    likely to occur at exposed sites within the grid cell. Hilltops, ridge crests,
    mountain summits, large clearings, and other locations free of local obstruction
    to the wind will be well exposed to the wind. In contrast, locations in narrow
    valleys and canyons, downwind of hills or obstructions, or in forested or urban
    areas are likely to have poor wind exposure.'

  description: This dataset represents the area of each physiographic province (Fenneman
    and Johnson, 1946) in square meters, compiled for every catchment of NHDPlus for
    the conterminous United States. The source data are from Fenneman and Johnson's
    Physiographic Provinces of the United States, which is based on 8 major divisions,
    25 provinces, and 86 sections representing distinctive areas having common topography,
    rock type and structure, and geologic and geomorphic history (Fenneman and Johnson,
    1946). The NHDPlus Version 1.1 is an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial
    datasets that incorporates many of the best features of the National Hydrography
    Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus includes a
    stream network (based on the 1:100,00-scale NHD), improved networking, naming,
    and value-added attributes (VAAs). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments
    (drainage areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first widely
    used in New England, and thus referred to as "the New England Method." This technique
    involves "burning in" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available building "walls"
    using the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital
    elevation model (HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree
    with the NHD and WBD. Over the past two years, an interdisciplinary team from
    the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (USEPA), and contractors, found that this method produces the best quality NHD
    catchments using an automated process (USEPA, 2007). The NHDPlus dataset is organized
    by 18 Production Units that cover the conterminous United States. The NHDPlus
    version 1.1 data are grouped by the U.S. Geologic Survey's Major River Basins
    (MRBs, Crawford and others, 2006). MRB1, covering the New England and Mid-Atlantic
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 1 and 2. MRB2, covering the South
    Atlantic-Gulf and Tennessee River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 3
    and 6. MRB3, covering the Great Lakes, Ohio, Upper Mississippi, and Souris-Red-Rainy
    River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 4, 5, 7 and 9. MRB4, covering
    the Missouri River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 10-lower and 10-upper.
    MRB5, covering the Lower Mississippi, Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf River
    basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units 8, 11 and 12. MRB6, covering the Rio
    Grande, Colorado and Great Basin River basins, contains NHDPlus Production Units
    13, 14, 15 and 16. MRB7, covering the Pacific Northwest River basins, contains
    NHDPlus Production Unit 17. MRB8, covering California River basins, contains NHDPlus
    Production Unit 18.

  description: The purpose of HAPCs is to focus conservation, management, and research
    efforts on subsets of EFH that are vulnerable to degradation or are especially
    important ecologically for federally managed fish. The HAPC designation alone
    does not confer additional protection or restrictions to an area, but helps to
    focus EFH conservation, management, and research priorities. HAPC designation
    is a valuable way to acknowledge areas where we have detailed information on ecological
    function and habitat vulnerability, indicating a greater need for conservation
    and management. In some instances the Councils and NMFS may develop fishery management
    measures to conserve the habitat within the HAPC.HAPCs are a subset of EFH that
    deserve special attention because they provide extremely important ecological
    functions and/or are especially vulnerable to degradation. For instance, HAPC
    designation may be warranted for areas that play a vital role in the reproductive
    cycle of a managed species (e.g., grouper spawning sites) or areas that contain
    a rare habitat type (e.g., corals) that may be sensitive to disturbance from fishing
    or other human activities.Councils may designate an area as a HAPC for one or
    more of the following reasons:The habitat provides important ecological functionsThe
    habitat is sensitive to human-induced environmental degradationDevelopment activities
    are, or will be, stressing the habitatThe habitat type is rare.

  _identifier: C195219674-GSFCS4PA
  _poc_org: National Aeronautics and Space Administration
  description: This data set contains the forcing data for Phase 1 of the North American
    Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-1). The data are in 1/8th degree grid spacing
    and range from 29 Sep 1996 to 31 Dec 2007. The temporal resolution is hourly.
    The file format is WMO GRIB-1. The chief source of NLDAS-1 forcing is NCEP&apos;s
    Eta model-based Data Assimilation System (EDAS) [Rogers et al., 1995], a continuously
    cycled North American 4DDA system. It utilizes 3-hourly analysis-forecast cycles
    to derive atmospheric states by assimilating many types of observations, including
    station observations of surface pressure and screen-level atmospheric temperature,
    humidity, and U and V wind components. EDAS 3-hourly fields of the latter five
    variables plus surface downward shortwave and longwave radiation and total and
    convective precipitation are provided on a 40-km grid, and then interpolated spatially
    to the NLDAS grid and temporally to one hour. Last, to account for NLDAS versus
    EDAS surface-elevation differences, a terrain-height adjustment is applied to
    the air temperature and surface pressure using a standard lapse rate (6.5 K/km),
    then to specific humidity (keeping original relative humidity) and downward longwave
    radiation (for new air temperature, specific humidity). The details of the spatial
    interpolation, temporal disaggregation, and vertical adjustment are presented
    by Cosgrove et al. (2003). GOES-based solar insolation (Pinker et al., 2003) provides
    the primary insolation forcing (shorwave down at the surface) for NLDAS-1. GOES
    insolation is not retrieved for zenith angles below 75 degrees and so is supplemented
    with EDAS insolation near the day/night terminator. Last from the GOES-based product
    suite, Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and surface brightness temperature
    fields are included in the NLDAS-1 forcing files. NLDAS-1 precipitation forcing
    over CONUS is anchored to NCEP&apos;s 1/4th degree gauge-only daily precipitation
    analyses of Higgins et al. [2000]. In NLDAS-1, this daily analysis is interpolated
    to 1/8th degree, then temporally disaggregated to hourly values by applying hourly
    weights derived from hourly, 4-km, radar-based (WSR-88D) precipitation fields.
    The latter radar-based fields are used only to derive disaggregation weights and
    do not change the daily total precipitation. Last, convective precipitation is
    estimated by multiplying NLDAS-1 total precipitation by the ratio of EDAS convective
    to EDAS total precipitation. The Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)
    is the final variable in the forcing dataset, also interpolated from EDAS. The
    data set applies a user-defined parameter table to indicate the contents and parameter
    number. The following table shows a list of parameters, their Product Definition

  description: This NOAA Fundamental Climate Data Record (FCDR) from Colorado State
    University (CSU) contains brightness temperatures that have been improved and
    quality-controlled over the observation time period. The temperature data are
    from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and Special Sensor Microwave
    Imager Sounder (SSMIS) series of passive microwave radiometers carried onboard
    the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites. This dataset encompasses
    data from a total of nine satellites including the SSM/I sensors on board DMSP
    satellites F08, F10, F11, F13, F14, and F15 as well as the SSMIS sensors on board
    DMSP satellites F16, F17, and F18. The data record covers the time period from
    July 1987 through the present with a 7 to 10 day latency. The spatial and temporal
    resolutions of the FCDR files correspond to the original resolution of the source
    TDR observations. There are roughly 15 orbits per day with a swath width of approximately
    1400 km resulting in nearly global daily coverage. The spatial resolution of the
    data is a function of the sensor/channel and varies from approximately ~50 km
    for the lowest frequency channels to ~15km for the high-frequency channels. The
    processing of the FCDR from the BASE Temperature Data Record (TDR) (also produced
    by CSU) includes a rigorous quality control of the original TDR data, updated
    geolocation information, corrections for known issues/problems, and adjustments
    for residual intercalibration differences between sensors. The output parameters
    include the observed brightness temperatures for each of the seven SSM/I channels
    and 24 SSMIS channels at the original sensor channel resolution along with latitude
    and longitude for each pixel, time, quality flags, and view angle information.
    The file format is netCDF-4 with added metadata that follow the Climate and Forecast
    (CF) Conventions and Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD).

  description: 'This data set contains gridded brightness temperatures and sea ice
    concentrations for both polar regions. It spans the period from October 1978 through
    August 1987, when the Nimbus-7 SMMR scanner was turned off. The data were collected
    every other day at 6.60, 10.69, 18.00, 21.00 and 37.00 GHz. Due to spacecraft
    power limitations, the scanner operated only on alternate days. There are usually
    at least foutreen days of coverage per month, although major data gaps occurred
    during the month of August. In August 1982, the following days are missing for
    both polar regions: 4th, 8th, and 16th; in August 1984, the 13th through the 23rd
    are missing for both polar regions; and in August 1985, the 6th through 8th are
    missing for the Southern Hemisphere. Brightness temperature and sea ice concentration
    grids have 25 x 25 km grid elements in polar stereographic projection. Volume
    7 contains all SMMR sea ice concentrations for both polar regions, plus five months
    of brightness temperature grids for the North polar region. Brightness temperature
    grids are stored as 16-bit integers, one day of brightness temperature data is
    0.27 mbytes for the North polar region, 0.21 mbytes for the South. Ice grids are
    stored as 8-bit integers. Files contain 136192 bytes and 104912 bytes for the
    North and South respectively. The NASA Team Algorithm (Cavalieri et al. 1984,
    Gloersen and Cavalieri 1986) was used to calculate ice concentrations from the
    brightness temperatures. The data were produced by Dr. P. Gloersen, NASA/GSFC,
    Oceans and Ice Branch, and are available via FTP. Notice to Data Users: SMMR TCT
    tapes comprised the input data set, unlike the SMMR Digital Media product distributed
    by NSIDC in 1979.'

  description: The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) research program has been in
    existence since mandated by Congress in 1928. FIA's primary objective is to determine
    the extent, condition, volume, growth, and depletion of timber on the Nation's
    forest land. Before 1999, all inventories were conducted on a periodic basis.
    The passage of the 1998 Farm Bill requires FIA to collect data annually on plots
    within each State. This kind of up-to-date information is essential to frame realistic
    forest policies and programs. Summary reports for individual States are published
    but the Forest Service also provides data collected in each inventory to those
    interested in further analysis. Data is distributed via the FIA DataMart in a
    standard format. This standard format, referred to as the Forest Inventory and
    Analysis Database (FIADB) structure, was developed to provide users with as much
    data as possible in a consistent manner among States. A number of inventories
    conducted prior to the implementation of the annual inventory are available in
    the FIADB. However, various data attributes may be empty or the items may have
    been collected or computed differently. Annual inventories use a common plot design
    and common data collection procedures nationwide, resulting in greater consistency
    among FIA work units than earlier inventories. Links to field collection manuals
    and the FIADB user’s manual are provided in the FIA DataMart.

  description: A map service on the www depicting watershed indexes to help identify
    areas of interest for protecting surface drinking water quality. The dataset depicted
    in this map service provides a watershed index of surface drinking water importance,
    a watershed index of forest importance to surface drinking water, and a watershed
    index to highlight the extent to which development, fire, and insects and disease
    threaten forests important for surface drinking water. This tabular dataset is
    meant to be joined with the NRCS Watershed Boundary Dataset HUC-12. The results
    of this assessment provides information that can identify areas of interest for
    protecting surface drinking water quality. The spatial dataset can be incorporated
    into broad-scale planning, such as the State Forest Action Plans, and can be incorporated
    into existing decision support tools that currently lack spatial data on important
    areas for surface drinking water. This project also sets the groundwork for identifying
    watersheds where a payment for watershed services (PWS) scheme may be an option
    for financing forest conservation and management on private unprotected forest
    lands. In perhaps its most important but most basic role, this work can serve
    as an education tool helping to illustrate the link between forests and provision
    of key watershed-based ecosystem services.

  description: 'This archive contains daily downscaled meteorological and hydrological
    projections for the Columbia Basin in the United States at 1/16-deg resolution
    utilizing 9 different downscaling methods. The downscaled meteorological variables
    are maximum/minimum temperature(tasmax/tasmin), precipitation amount(pr), downward
    shortwave solar radiation(rsds), wind speed(was), and specific humidity(huss).
    The downscaling is based on the CCSM3e model from Phase 3 of the Coupled Model
    Inter-comparison Project (CMIP3) utlizing the historical 20C3M (1971-1999) and
    future SRESA2(2041-2070) scenarios. The downscaling methods include 3 statistical
    downscaling methods: Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) and monthly(and
    daily) Bias Correction Spatial Dissaggregation (mBCSD,dBCSD); 3 dynamical downscaling
    methods: interpolations of the outputs from North American Regional Climate Change
    Assessment Program(sdNARCCAP) regional downscaling utilizing 3 regional models:
    CRCM,MM5I and WRFG; and 3 hybrid downscaling methods: bias correction of interpolated
    outputs from NARCCAP regional downscaling using CRCM,MM5I and WRFG. All of the
    methods are used to downscale the entire suite of variables except for mBCSD (which
    is only used to downscale tmax/tmin/pr and these results are used with MTCLIM(Glassy
    et al., 1994) to generate rsds/was/huss). Each of the downscaling outputs are
    run through the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to generate
    the hydrological projections.'

  description: 'The Gridded Satellite (GridSat-B1) data provides a uniform set of
    quality controlled geostationary satellite observations for the visible, infrared
    window and infrared water vapor channels. GridSat-B1 uses the International Satellite
    Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) B1 dataset providing coverage every 3 hours
    from 1980 to the present, and is updated quarterly as possible. The ISCCP B1 data
    have been quality controlled, calibrated, remapped and merged together to provide
    a nearly global coverage of top of the atmosphere radiances. Long-term temporal
    normalization is performed via calibration against HIRS channel 12 data during
    the period of record. The IR window channel data has received more extensive inter-satellite
    calibration and is thus identified as a Climate Data Record (CDR) by the NOAA
    CDR Program. GridSat-B1 data are projected on an equal angle grid, which facilitates
    the mapping and subsetting of the data. Since the ISCCP B1 native resolution is
    approximately 8km, the resolution of the equal area grid is 0.07 degrees latitude
    (approximately 8km at the Equator). The data span the globe in longitude and range
    from 70 degrees South to 70 degrees North latitude. GridSat version 2 differs
    from version 1 in the following ways: a) three channels are provided instead of
    just one, b) more quality control on the calibration, navigation and flagging
    of bad data, and c) extension of the period of record. Data are stored using netCDF-4
    file format following the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions and the Attribute
    Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) which facilitates usage with compatible
    software applications. Documentation and source code are available for the dataset.'

  description: These Bathymetric Digital Elevation Models (DEM) were generated from
    original point soundings collected during hydrographic surveys conducted by the
    National Ocean Service and its predecessors. Mean High Water shoreline was used
    as a constraining boundary and assigned its local elevation relative to the local
    datum (typically Mean Low Water). DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land)
    were assigned null values (-32676). In the event of multiple surveys in a region,
    the most recent survey soundings were retained. Both 7.5 minute and 1 degree DEMs
    are available. The 1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7.5
    minute DEMs which covered the estuary. These DEMs are available as either Untiled
    (large grids) or sets of Tiled DEMs (at 7.5 degree minute size).A Digital Elevation
    Model (DEM) contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the
    order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header
    record (A- record), followed by a series of profile records (B- records) each
    of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer
    elevations (typically in units of 1 centimeter {0.01 meter]) per each profile.
    The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C-record).The 1 degree
    (60-minute) DEMs (3 arc second x 3 arc second data spacing) is cast on the geographic
    coordinate system (no projection). It provides coverage in 1 degree square blocks.
    Each product contains over edge data. Coverage is available for the many estuaries
    of the conterminous United States, but is not complete.The 7.5-minute DEM (30-
    by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection.
    It provides coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same
    coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but the DEM contains over edge
    data. Coverage is available for many estuaries of the contiguous United States
    but is not complete.

  description: 'Beach erosion is a chronic problem along most open-ocean shores of
    the United States. As coastal populations continue to grow, and community infrastructures
    are threatened by erosion, there is increased demand for accurate information
    regarding past and present shoreline changes. There is also need for a comprehensive
    analysis of shoreline movement that is regionally consistent. To meet these national
    needs, the USGS National Assessment of Shoreline Change Project has collected
    and analyzed a comprehensive database of digital vector shorelines by compiling
    shoreline positions from pre-existing historical shoreline databases and by generating
    historical and modern shoreline data. This dataset consists of short-term (~30
    years) shoreline change rates. Rate calculations were computed using the Digital
    Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), an ArcGIS extension developed by the U.S. Geological
    Survey. Short-term rates of shoreline change were calculated using an end-point
    rate method based on available shorelines to provide an approximately 30-yr short-term
    rate. A reference baseline was used as the originating point for the orthogonal
    transects cast by the DSAS software. The transects intersect each shoreline establishing
    measurement points, which are then used to calculate short-term rates. To make
    these results more accessible to the public and other agencies, the USGS created
    this web service. This web service was created utilizing ESRI ArcServer. This
    service meets open geospatial consortium standards. The data compilation used
    to derive the shoreline change rates is available in a service with the title
    USGS Map service: National Shoreline Change - Historic Shorelines by State. The
    reference baseline used to derive the shoreline change rates is available in a
    service with the title USGS Map service: National Shoreline Change - Offshore
    Baseline. The locations of the transects used in the change rate calculation are
    available in a service with the title USGS Map service: National Shoreline Change
    - Intersection Points. The geographic information system (GIS) data layers from
    this web service are cataloged by state for ease of access.'

    from 23 October 1978 through 29 June 2014, and snow cover alone from 03 October
    1966 through 29 June 2014. Snow cover extent for this data set is based on the
    NOAA/NCDC Climate Data Record (CDR) of Northern Hemisphere (NH) Snow Cover Extent
    (SCE) by D. Robinson (2012) and regridded to the EASE-Grid. The NOAA/NCDC CDR
    of Northern Hemisphere Snow Cover Extent data were derived from the manual interpretation
    of AVHRR, GOES, and other visible-band satellite data (Helfrich et al. 2007).
    Sea ice extent is regridded to EASE-Grid from Sea Ice Concentrations from Nimbus-7
    SMMR and DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS Passive Microwave Data. Designed to facilitate study
    of Northern Hemisphere seasonal fluctuations of snow cover and sea ice extent,
    the data set also includes monthly climatologies describing average extent, probability
    of occurrence, and variance. Data are provided in flat, unsigned binary files
    and are available via FTP.

    Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for 24 cetacean species, stocks, or populations
    in seven regions (US East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, West Coast, Hawaiian Islands,
    Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, and Arctic [encompassing the
    northeastern Chukchi and western Beaufort seas]) within US waters. BIAs are reproductive
    areas, feeding areas, migratory corridors, and areas in which small and resident
    populations are concentrated. BIAs are region-, species-, and time-specific. Information
    provided for each BIA includes the following: 1) a written narrative describing
    the information, assumptions, and logic used to delineate the BIA; 2) a map of
    the BIA; 3) a list of references used in the assessment; and 4) a metadata table
    that concisely details the type and quantity of information used to define a BIA,
    providing transparency in how BIAs were designated in a quick reference table
    format. BIAs were identified through an expert elicitation process. The delineation
    of BIAs does not have direct or immediate regulatory consequences. Rather, the
    BIA assessment is intended to provide the best available science to help inform
    regulatory and management decisions under existing authorities about some, though
    not all, important cetacean areas in order to minimize the impacts of anthropogenic
    activities on cetaceans and to achieve conservation and protection goals. In addition,
    the BIAs and associated information may be used to identify information gaps and
    prioritize future research and modeling efforts to better understand cetaceans,
    their habitat, and ecosystems.'

  description: This EnviroAtlas dataset is a summary of the thermoelectric water consumption
    based on EPA eGRID and reported water consumption estimates from a 2009 DOE report.
    The file contains total water consumption in gallons per year, millions of gallons
    per year, and millions of gallons per day by 12-digit hydrologic units codes (HUCs)
    for March 2011. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and
    online mapping activities related to EnviroAtlas. EnviroAtlas (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas)
    allows the user to interact with a web-based, easy-to-use, mapping application
    to view and analyze multiple ecosystem services for the contiguous United States.
    The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas)
    or as an EnviroAtlas map service. Additional descriptive information about each
    attribute in this dataset can be found in its associated EnviroAtlas Fact Sheet
    (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov/EnviroAtlas/DataFactSheets).
